VAT225,"Vehicle and Traffic      225. Jurisdiction; transfer of cases; hearing officers; regulations.  1.  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, all violations of  this chapter or of a law, ordinance, order, rule or regulation  relating  to  traffic,  except parking, standing, stopping or pedestrian offenses,  which occur within a city having a population of two hundred thousand or  more in which administrative tribunals have heretofore been established,  and which are classified  as  traffic  infractions,  may  be  heard  and  determined  pursuant  to the regulations of the commissioner as provided  in this article. Whenever a crime and a traffic infraction arise out  of  the  same transaction or occurrence, a charge alleging both offenses may  be made returnable before the court having jurisdiction over the  crime.  Nothing  herein  provided  shall be construed to prevent a court, having  jurisdiction over a criminal charge relating to  traffic  or  a  traffic  infraction,  from lawfully entering a judgment of conviction, whether or  not based on a plea of guilty, for any offense classified as  a  traffic  infraction.    2.  Whenever  the  commissioner or his deputy determines that a charge  alleges an offense other than a traffic infraction, he shall, and  where  a  charge  cannot  be  disposed  of because of the non-appearance of the  motorist, he may  notify  the  court  of  appropriate  jurisdiction  and  request  removal of the case to such court. Prior notice of such request  need not be given the motorist involved. Upon receipt of  such  request,  the  court  may grant an order transferring such case, provided that the  date on which the charge or charges must be answered  before  the  court  shall not be earlier than the return date which appears on the complaint  alleging  the  offense. Notice of transfer of cases involving other than  traffic infractions shall be mailed  to  the  motorist  at  the  address  appearing  on  such  complaint not less than ten days before the date of  appearance indicated on his summons  and  not  less  than  fifteen  days  before  his  scheduled  appearance  in such court. Notice of transfer of  cases which cannot be disposed of because of the non-appearance  of  the  motorist  shall  be  mailed  to the motorist at the address appearing on  such  complaint  not  less  than  fifteen  days  before  his   scheduled  appearance  in  such  court. Such mailing shall constitute due notice of  such transfer. Thereafter, such case shall be treated in the same manner  as if the complaint had initially been filed with such court.    3. The commissioner shall appoint such hearing officers  as  shall  be  necessary  to  hear  and determine cases as provided by this article and  may promulgate such regulations as shall be necessary  or  desirable  to  effect  the purposes of this article. Such regulations may provide for a  schedule of monetary penalties to be used where an answer is made, other  than before a hearing officer, admitting a charge, provided that no such  penalty shall exceed the maximum fine established by law for the traffic  infraction involved."
VAT226,"Vehicle and Traffic       226.  Summons;  answer.  1.  Summons.  The  commissioner  shall  be  authorized to prescribe by regulation  the  form  for  the  summons  and  complaint to be used for all traffic violations specified in subdivision  one of section two hundred twenty-five of this chapter, and to establish  procedures  for  proper  administrative  controls  over  the disposition  thereof. Such summons may be the same as the  uniform  summons  provided  for  in  section  two hundred seven of this chapter. The chief executive  officer of each local police force which is required to use the  summons  and  complaint provided for herein shall prepare or cause to be prepared  such records and reports as may be prescribed by the commissioner.    2. Answer. (a) General. Any  person  who  receives  a  summons  for  a  violation   described   in   subdivision  one  of  section  two  hundred  twenty-five of this chapter shall  answer  such  summons  by  personally  appearing  on  the  return date at the time and place specified therein.  Provided, however, that an answer may be made as provided in  paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this subdivision and the regulations of the commissioner.    (b)  Answer  by  mail  -  admitting charge. If a person charged with a  violation admits to the violation as charged  in  the  summons,  he  may  complete  an appropriate form prescribed by the commissioner and forward  such form and  summons,  together  with  the  appropriate  part  of  his  license, if required by the commissioner's regulations, to the office of  the department specified on such summons. If a schedule of penalties for  violations has been established, and such schedule appears on the answer  form,  a  check  or  money  order  in  the amount of the penalty for the  violation charged if included in such schedule, must also  be  submitted  with   such   answer.   Unless  permitted  by  the  regulations  of  the  commissioner, such plea may not be made by  mail  for  any  offense  for  which suspension or revocation of a driver's license is required by law,  or  for  any  other  offense if the conviction thereof would result in a  hearing pursuant to a  highway  safety  program  established  under  the  provisions  of  subdivision  three  of  section five hundred ten of this  chapter.    (c) Answer by mail - denial of charges. If the person charged with the  violation denies part or all of the violation as charged in the summons,  he may complete an appropriate form prescribed by the  commissioner  for  that  purpose  and  forward  such  form and summons to the office of the  department specified on such summons. Upon receipt, such answer shall be  entered and a hearing date established by the department. The department  shall notify such person by return mail of the date of such hearing.    3. Failure to answer or appear; entry of order.   (a)  If  the  person  charged  with the violation shall fail to answer the summons as provided  herein, the commissioner may suspend such person's  license  or  driving  privilege  or,  if  the  charge  involves  a  violation of section three  hundred eighty-five, section four hundred one or  section  five  hundred  eleven-a of this chapter by a registrant who was not the operator of the  vehicle,  the registration of such vehicle or the privilege of operation  of any motor vehicle owned by such registrant may  be  suspended,  until  such person shall answer as provided in subdivision two of this section.  If a person shall fail to appear at a hearing, when such is provided for  pursuant  to  this  section,  such  person's license, or registration or  privilege of operating or of operation, as appropriate, may be suspended  pending appearance at a subsequent hearing, or the  disposition  of  the  charges  involved.  Any  suspension  permitted  by  this subdivision, if  already in effect, may be terminated or if not yet  in  effect,  may  be  withdrawn  or withheld, prior to the disposition of the charges involved  if such person shall appear and post security in  the  amount  of  forty  dollars  to guarantee his or her appearance at any required hearing. The  security posted pursuant to this  subdivision  shall  be  returned  upon  appearance  at  the  scheduled  hearing  or  an  adjourned hearing which  results in a final disposition of the charge,  and  otherwise  shall  be  forfeited. If a suspension has been imposed pursuant to this subdivision  and  the case is subsequently transferred pursuant to subdivision two of  section two hundred twenty-five of this article, such  suspension  shall  remain  in  effect  until the person answers the charges in the court to  which the case was transferred. Any suspension issued pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall  be  subject  to  the  provisions of paragraph (j-1) of  subdivision two of section five hundred three of this chapter.    (b) Failure to answer or appear in accordance with the requirements of  this section and any regulations promulgated hereunder shall  be  deemed  an  admission  to the violation as charged, and an appropriate order may  be entered in the department's records, and a fine consistent  with  the  provisions  of  this  chapter and regulations of the commissioner may be  imposed by the commissioner or person designated  by  the  commissioner.  Prior  to  entry  of an order and imposition of a fine, the commissioner  shall notify such person by mail at the address of such person  on  file  with  the  department  or  at the current address provided by the United  States postal service in accordance with section two hundred fourteen of  this chapter: (i) of the violation charged; (ii) of the impending  entry  of such order and fine; (iii) that such order and fine may be filed as a  judgment  with  the  county clerk of the county in which the operator or  registrant is located; and (iv) that entry of such order and  imposition  of  such  fine may be avoided by entering a plea or making an appearance  within thirty days of the sending of such notice. In no case shall  such  an  order  and fine be entered and imposed more than two years after the  date of the alleged violation. Upon application in such manner and  form  as  the  commissioner shall prescribe an order and fine shall be vacated  upon the ground of excusable default."
VAT227,"Vehicle and Traffic      227. Hearings; determinations. 1. Every hearing for the adjudication  of  a  traffic  infraction,  as  provided by this article, shall be held  before a hearing officer appointed by the commissioner.  The  burden  of  proof  shall be upon the people, and no charge may be established except  by clear and convincing evidence. The  commissioner  may  prescribe,  by  rule or regulation, the procedures for the conduct of such hearings.    2. In any case wherein the people are not ready for the hearing on the  scheduled hearing date, the hearing officer may order a dismissal of the  charge  or  the  adjournment of the hearing to a subsequent time. In any  case wherein the people are not ready for  the  hearing  at  an  ordered  adjourned time and do not provide a minimum of seven days' notice to the  department  after  having been not ready for a hearing on the charge for  any reason previously, the charge shall be dismissed unless the  hearing  officer determines that a substantial traffic safety hazard would result  from  the  dismissal.  The  commissioner  shall  promulgate  regulations  concerning the adjournment of hearings which may permit the dismissal of  cases by a hearing officer for reasons not prescribed herein.    3. After due consideration of the evidence and arguments offered in  a  contested  case, the hearing officer shall determine whether the charges  have been established. Where the charges have not been  established,  an  order  dismissing the charges shall be entered. Where a determination is  made that a charge has been established, either in a contested  case  or  in  an  uncontested  case  where there is an appearance before a hearing  officer, or if  an  answer  admitting  the  charge  otherwise  has  been  received,  an  appropriate  order  shall  be entered in the department's  records.    4. a. An order entered upon the failure to answer or appear  or  after  the  receipt  of an answer admitting the charge or where a determination  is made that the charge has been established shall be civil  in  nature,  but  shall  be treated as a conviction for the purposes of this chapter.  The commissioner or his designee may include in such order an imposition  of any penalty authorized  by  any  provision  of  this  chapter  for  a  conviction  of  such  violation,  except that no penalty therefore shall  include imprisonment, nor, if monetary, exceed the amount  of  the  fine  which  could have been imposed had the charge been heard by a court. The  driver's license or privileges, or, if the charge involves  a  violation  of section three hundred eighty-five or section four hundred one of this  chapter  by  a  registrant  who was not the operator of the vehicle, the  registration of such vehicle or privilege  of  operation  of  any  motor  vehicle owned by such registrant may be suspended pending the payment of  any penalty so imposed. Any suspension issued pursuant to this paragraph  shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (j-1) of subdivision two  of section five hundred three of this chapter.    b. Unpaid fines may be recovered by the commissioner in a civil action  in  the name of the commissioner. In addition, as an alternative to such  civil action, and provided that no appeal is pending,  the  commissioner  may file with the county clerk of the county in which the person resides  a  final  order of the commissioner containing the amount of the fine or  fines. The filing of such final order shall  have  the  full  force  and  effect  of  a judgment duly docketed in the office of such clerk and may  be enforced in the same manner and with the same effect as that provided  by law in respect to execution issued against property upon judgments of  a court of record. No such civil action shall  be  commenced  nor  shall  such  final  order  be  filed  until  at  least  thirty  days  after the  department has posted by ordinary mail to the person at the  address  of  such  person  on  file  with  the  department  or at the current address  provided by the United States postal service notice  of  the  amount  of  such fine or fines and that such fine or fines are due and owing.    5.  All  penalties  and  forfeited  security collected pursuant to the  provisions of this article shall be paid to the department of audit  and  control  to the credit of the justice court fund and shall be subject to  the applicable provisions of section  eighteen  hundred  three  of  this  chapter.  After  such  audit  as  shall  reasonably  be  required by the  comptroller,  such  penalties  and  forfeited  security  shall  be  paid  quarterly  or,  in  the  discretion  of the comptroller, monthly, to the  appropriate jurisdiction in which the violation occurred  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of section ninety-nine-a of the state finance law,  except that the sum of four dollars for each violation occurring in such  jurisdiction  for  which  a  complaint   has   been   filed   with   the  administrative  tribunal  established  pursuant to this article shall be  retained by the state. The amount distributed  during  the  first  three  quarters to the cities of Rochester and Buffalo in any given fiscal year  shall  not  exceed seventy percent of the amount which will be otherwise  payable. Provided, however, that if the full costs of administering this  article shall exceed the amounts received and retained by the state  for  any  period  specified by the commissioner, then such additional sums as  shall be required to offset such costs shall be retained  by  the  state  out  of  the penalties and forfeited security collected pursuant to this  article.    6. Unless a hearing officer shall determine that a substantial traffic  safety  hazard  would  result  therefrom,  he  shall,  pursuant  to  the  regulations  of  the commissioner, delay for a period of thirty days the  effective date of any suspension or revocation of a drivers  license  or  vehicle  registration  imposed after a hearing pursuant to this article,  unless such suspension was imposed because  of  the  failure  to  pay  a  monetary  penalty. Provided, however, the commissioner's regulations may  provide for the immediate surrender of  any  item  to  be  suspended  or  revoked  and  the  issuance of appropriate temporary documentation to be  used during such thirty day period."

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, a transcript  of  the  hearing  resulting  in  the  determination  appealed  from  must be  submitted on any such appeal.    (c) If the only issue raised on appeal is the appropriateness  of  the  penalty  imposed,  the  appellant,  in  his  discretion, may submit such  appeal without a transcript of the hearing. In such event, the  decision  of  the  appeals  board may be based solely on the appeal papers and the  records of the department, and such decision shall  not  be  subject  to  judicial review.    (d)  Where  a  transcript  of  the hearing is submitted at the time an  appeal is filed, the determination of the appeals board will be  subject  to judicial review as prescribed in subdivision nine of this section.    3. Appeals boards. Each appeal filed pursuant to this section shall be  reviewed  by  an appeals board, which shall make a determination of such  appeal, and shall cause an  appropriate  order  to  be  entered  in  the  records of the department.    4.  Time  limitations. No appeal shall be reviewed if it is filed more  than thirty days after notice was given of  the  determination  appealed  from.    5.  Appeal  procedures.  Any person desiring to file an appeal from an  adverse determination pursuant to this section, shall do so  in  a  form  and  manner  provided by the commissioner. The transcript of any hearing  which formed the basis for such determination will be reviewed  only  if  it  is  submitted  by the appellant. An appeal shall not be deemed to be  finally submitted  until  the  appellant  has  submitted  all  forms  or  documents required to be submitted by the commissioner or this section.    6.  Transcript  of  hearings. Transcripts of the record of any hearing  may be obtained at the cost  to  the  department,  if  prepared  by  the  department,  or  at  the  rate  specified  in  the  contract between the  department and the contractor, if prepared by a private contractor.

Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of any general, special  or local law or administrative code to the contrary,  any  city  with  a  population  in  excess  of one hundred thousand persons according to the  nineteen hundred eighty United States census hereinafter referred to  as  a  city shall provide notice of parking violations and of the imposition  of additional penalties whenever the person who is liable therefor fails  to respond to the parking ticket in the manner designated thereon.  Such  notice   shall   be   in  substantial  conformance  with  the  following  provisions:    a. Notice. (1) Whenever a city issues a  notice  of  violation  for  a  parking  violation,  it  shall  be  served  in  the manner prescribed by  subdivision two of section two hundred thirty-eight of this article.    (2) Whenever a person has been issued a  notice  of  violation  for  a  parking  violation  and has not responded in the manner described in the  notice, a city shall give the owner a second notice of the violation  by  regular first class mail: (i) within forty days of issuance of the first  notice  of  violation  for  a  parking  violation where the vehicle is a  vehicle registered in this state; or  (ii)  within  forty  days  of  the  receipt by such city of the name and address of the owner of the vehicle  where  the  vehicle  is  a  vehicle  registered in any other state. Such  second notice shall include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the  following  information:    (A)  that  the  owner has a period of twenty days from issuance of the  second notice in which to respond to  the  notice  of  violation  for  a  parking violation;    (B)  that  failure to respond to the notice of violation for a parking  violation may result in the suspension and non-renewal  of  the  owner's  registration;    (C)  that  failure to respond to the notice of violation for a parking  violation may subject the owner to additional penalties as  provided  in  paragraph b of this subdivision;    (D)  that  failure to respond to the notice of violation for a parking  violation shall subject the owner to a default judgment as  provided  in  paragraph  c  of  this  subdivision and the additional penalties imposed  upon parking violations pursuant to paragraph b of this subdivision; and    (E) that submission of a plea of guilty to the parking violation makes  the owner liable for payment of the stated fine and additional penalties  imposed pursuant to paragraph b of this subdivision  and  the  mandatory  surcharge of fifteen dollars imposed upon parking violations pursuant to  section eighteen hundred nine-a of this chapter.    (1)  Upon  written  application  of the chief executive officer of any  such city, the commissioner may authorize for a  specified  time  period  the  use  of  a  notice  mailer  form  that  does  not  contain  all the  information set forth in this subdivision but which  was  used  by  such  city on or before the effective date of this section.    (2)  In  addition,  the  commissioner  may suspend for a period not to  exceed one year from the effective date of this section  the  provisions  of  this  subdivision  requiring  that  a  second notice of violation be  served within forty days of issuance of the first notice  of  a  parking  violation,  upon  written  application of the chief executive officer of  any such city demonstrating that immediate  imposition  of  such  notice  requirement  will cause substantial financial hardship to such city, and  setting forth the steps to be taken by such city to  achieve  compliance  with  the notice requirements of this subdivision at the end of such one  hundred  eighty  day  period.  Upon  granting  such   application,   the  commissioner  shall  specify  a period, not to exceed seventy-five days,  within which such  second  notice  must  be  served,  and  shall  adjust  accordingly   the  time  periods  set  forth  in  paragraph  b  of  this  subdivision to provide that the additional penalties set forth  in  such  subdivision  will not be imposed prior to the stated number of days from  the service of such notice.    b. Additional penalties. (1) For the purposes of this paragraph,  each  locality shall determine an initial response date of not less than eight  days  nor  more  than  thirty  days,  after  which time a penalty may be  imposed. The liability for such initial penalty shall  commence  on  the  date following the initial response date.    (2)  Failure  to  respond  to  a  notice  of  violation  for a parking  violation by the initial response date may result in the liability for a  penalty in an amount of the fine indicated on the  notice  of  violation  for a parking violation; where a city has given a second notice pursuant  to paragraph a of this subdivision, the following schedule of additional  penalties may apply:    (A)  failure  to  respond  to  a  notice  of  violation  for a parking  violation by the initial response date may result in the  liability  for  an additional penalty not to exceed ten dollars or, if the first penalty  assessed by a city does not exceed five dollars, such city may assess an  additional  penalty within thirty-one to seventy-five days not to exceed  ten dollars; and    (B) where a city has given a second notice pursuant to paragraph a  of  this  subdivision  failure  to  respond  to  a notice of violation for a  parking violation within seventy-five days may result in the  liability,  commencing  on  the  seventy-sixth day, for an additional penalty not to  exceed twenty dollars.

For  the  purposes of this subdivision, the provisions of this paragraph shall not  be  considered to have been implemented and in effect unless the penalty  schedule contained herein shall have been applied to parking  violations  issued  in  such  city  on  or  before  January  first, nineteen hundred  ninety-three.    b-1.

In the event that no such  local law is enacted within forty-five days of  the  effective  date  of  this  paragraph,  the alternate additional penalty schedule set forth in  paragraph b-2 of this subdivision shall apply.    (1) Failure to  respond  to  a  notice  of  violation  for  a  parking  violation  within  thirty  days shall result in liability, commencing on  the thirty-first day, for an additional penalty  in  an  amount  not  to  exceed  ten  dollars, indicated on the notice of violation for a parking  violation: where a city has given a second notice pursuant to  paragraph  a  of this subdivision failure to respond to a notice of violation for a  parking violation  within  forty-five  days  may  result  in  liability,  commencing  on the forty-sixth day, for the penalty prescribed above for  failure to respond within thirty days and an additional penalty  not  to  exceed  twenty  dollars;  and  where  a  city  has given a second notice  pursuant to paragraph a of this subdivision  failure  to  respond  to  a  notice of violation for a parking violation within seventy-five days may  result  in  liability,  commencing  on  the  seventy-sixth  day, for the  penalties prescribed above for failure to respond within thirty days and  for failure to respond within forty-five days and an additional  penalty  not to exceed thirty dollars.    (2)  Notwithstanding  the foregoing schedule of alternative additional  penalties, if an owner makes a plea or appears within twenty days  after  issuance  of a second notice of violation in accordance with paragraph a  of this subdivision, or prior to such mailing, such  additional  penalty  shall not exceed ten dollars.    b-2.

Application. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any rule  or regulation previously or heretofore issued  prior  to  the  effective  date of this paragraph by any state or local agency, division, bureau or  other  entity, authorizing the imposition of an additional penalty equal  to the amount of the initial fine for failure to respond  to  the  first  notice  of  violation  within  eight days of its issuance shall be of no  force and effect in a city to which the provisions of paragraph  b-1  or  b-2 of this subdivision apply.    c.  Default  judgment.  Where  a  city  has  given  notice pursuant to  paragraph a of this subdivision, failure  to  respond  to  a  notice  of  violation  for a parking violation within ninety days shall be deemed an  admission of liability and shall subject the owner to a default judgment  being entered thereon in an amount not greater than the  amount  of  the  original fine and accrued penalties plus any applicable surcharges. Such  default shall be reported to the department which department shall cause  a suspension and non-renewal of the owner's registration pursuant to the  provisions  of  subdivision  four-c  of section five hundred ten of this  chapter.    * NB Effective until September 1, 2015    *  235.

A  duplicate  of  each  notice  of violation shall be served on the person charged in the manner  hereinafter provided. The original or a facsimile thereof shall be filed  and retained by the bureau, and shall be deemed a  record  kept  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business, and shall be prima facie evidence of the  facts contained therein.    2. A notice of violation shall be served personally upon the  operator  of  a motor vehicle who is present at the time of service, and his name,  together with the plate designation and the plate type as shown  by  the  registration plates of said vehicle and the expiration date; the make or  model,  and  body  type  of  said  vehicle; a description of the charged  violation, including but not limited to a reference  to  the  applicable  traffic  rule  or  provision of this chapter; information as to the days  and hours the applicable rule or provision of this chapter is in effect,  unless always in effect pursuant to  rule  or  this  chapter  and  where  appropriate  the  word  ALL  when  the  days  and/or hours in effect are  everyday and/or twenty-four hours a day; the meter number  for  a  meter  violation, where appropriate; and the date, time and particular place of  occurrence  of  the charged violation, shall be inserted therein. A mere  listing of a meter number in cases of charged meter violations shall not  be deemed to constitute a sufficient description of a  particular  place  of  occurrence for purposes of this subdivision. The notice of violation  shall be served upon the owner of the motor vehicle if the  operator  is  not  present,  by  affixing such notice to said vehicle in a conspicuous  place. Whenever such notice is so affixed, in lieu of inserting the name  of the person charged with the violation in the space provided  for  the  identification  of  said person, the words ""owner of the vehicle bearing  license"" may be inserted to be followed by  the  plate  designation  and  plate  type as shown by the registration plates of said vehicle together  with the expiration date; the make or  model,  and  body  type  of  said  vehicle;  a  description  of  the  charged  violation, including but not  limited to a reference to the applicable traffic rule  or  provision  of  this  chapter;  information as to the days and hours the applicable rule  or provision of this chapter  is  in  effect  unless  always  in  effect  pursuant to rule or this chapter and where appropriate the word ALL when  the days and/or hours in effect are every day and/or twenty-four hours a  day;  the  meter number for a meter violation where appropriate; and the  date, time and particular place of occurrence of the charged  violation.  Service of the notice of violation, or a duplicate thereof by affixation  as  herein  provided  shall  have the same force and effect and shall be  subject to the same penalties for disregard thereof as though  the  same  was  personally  served  with  the  name  of the person charged with the  violation inserted therein.    2-a. (a) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of subdivision two  of this section, where the plate type or the  expiration  date  are  not  shown on either the registration plates or sticker of a vehicle or where  the registration sticker is covered, faded, defaced or mutilated so that  it  is  unreadable, the plate type or the expiration date may be omitted  from the notice of violation; provided, however, such condition must  be  so described and inserted on the notice of violation.    (b) If any information which is required to be inserted on a notice of  violation  is  omitted  from  the  notice of violation, misdescribed, or  illegible, the violation shall be  dismissed  upon  application  of  the  person charged with the violation.    (c)  (i)  A  determination dismissing a charged parking violation that  has  been  procured  due  to  the  knowing   fraud,   false   testimony,  misrepresentation,  or  other misconduct, or the knowing alteration of a  notice of parking violation, by the person so  charged  or  his  or  her  agent,  employee,  or  representative  may  be  set  aside  by a hearing  examiner as hereinafter provided.    (ii) Notice shall be served on the owner by mail  to  the  last  known  registered  address  within  two  years  of  the time that the enforcing  authority discovers, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered,  that the  dismissal  was  procured  due  to  the  knowing  fraud,  false  testimony,  misrepresentation,  or  other  misconduct,  or  the  knowing  alteration of a notice of parking violation, by the person so charged or  his or her agent, employee, or representative. Such notice shall  fix  a  time  when  and  place  where  a  hearing shall be held before a hearing  examiner to determine whether or not  dismissal  of  a  charged  parking  violation  shall be set aside. Such notice shall set forth the basis for  setting aside the dismissal and advise the owner that failure to  appear  at  the  date  and  time  indicated  in  such  notice shall be deemed an  admission of liability and shall result in  the  setting  aside  of  the  dismissal and entry of a determination on the charged parking violation.  Such  notice  shall  also  contain a warning that civil penalties may be  imposed for the violation pursuant to this paragraph and that a  default  judgment may be entered thereon.    (iii)  Upon  a  finding  by a hearing examiner that the dismissal of a  charged parking violation has been procured due to  the  knowing  fraud,  false  testimony, misrepresentation, or other misconduct, or the knowing  alteration of a notice of parking violation, by the person so charged or  his or her agent, employee, or representative, the  dismissal  shall  be  set  aside  and a determination may be rendered against the owner on the  charged parking violation. The  hearing  examiner  may  impose  monetary  penalties  for  the  charged  parking violation of up to three times the  scheduled  fine  for  the  violation  and  three  times  the  additional  penalties  that  may  be  imposed  for failure to respond to a notice of  violation pursuant to section two hundred thirty-five of  this  article.  For purposes of determining the amount of such additional penalties, the  hearing  examiner  shall  disregard the plea that procured the dismissal  that has been set aside and shall calculate such penalties as  if  there  had  been  no  plea  or  appearance in the proceeding. In any proceeding  under this  paragraph  to  set  aside  a  determination  and  to  impose  penalties  for  the violation, it shall not be necessary for the hearing  examiner to find that the owner personally committed the  unlawful  acts  that procured the dismissal of the violation.    (iv)  Failure  to  appear  at a hearing in response to a notice issued  pursuant to this paragraph  shall  be  deemed  to  be  an  admission  of  liability for the charged parking violation as set forth in the original  notice  of  violation  and a default judgment may be entered against the  owner in the maximum amount set forth  in  subparagraph  (iii)  of  this  paragraph.    (v)  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of section two hundred  forty-one of this article, a default judgment may be entered pursuant to  this paragraph more than two years after  the  expiration  of  the  time  prescribed  for entering a plea or contesting an allegation, but no more  than two years of the time that the enforcing  authority  discovers,  or  could  with reasonable diligence have discovered, that the dismissal was  procured due to the knowing fraud, false  testimony,  misrepresentation,  or  other  misconduct,  or the knowing alteration of a notice of parking  violation.    3.  For  purposes of this section, an operator of a vehicle who is not  the owner thereof but  who  uses  or  operates  such  vehicle  with  the  permission  of  the owner, express or implied, shall be deemed to be the  agent of such owner to receive notices of violation, whether  personally  served on such operator or served by affixation in the manner aforesaid,  and  service  made  in  either  manner  as herein provided shall also be  deemed to be lawful service upon such owner."

The  lessor  of  a  motor vehicle shall not be liable for fines or  penalties imposed pursuant to this article if:    (1) prior to the infraction, the lessor has filed with the bureau  the  registration  plate number, plate type, and place of registration of the  vehicle to which the  notice  of  violation  was  issued  and  paid  the  required filing fee provided in paragraph f of this subdivision and,    (2) within thirty-seven days after receiving notice from the bureau of  the  date  and  time of a violation, together with the other information  contained in the original notice of violation, the lessor submits to the  bureau the correct name  and  address  of  the  lessee  of  the  vehicle  identified  in  the  notice  of violation at the time of such violation,  together with such other additional information contained in the rental,  lease or other contract document, as may be reasonably required  by  the  bureau pursuant to regulations that may be promulgated for such purpose.    c.

Where the United States postal authorities return to the  bureau  a  delinquency  notice  forwarded  by the bureau to a name and address of a  lessee furnished by a lessor  in  accordance  with  provisions  of  this  section,  such  return  notice  shall  be  presumptive  evidence  of the  furnishing of an incorrect name and address by the  lessor.  The  lessor  may,  however,  conclusively rebut such presumption if within sixty days  after receiving notification from  the  bureau  of  such  returned  mail  notice,  the  lessor  shall  provide  to the bureau a copy of the rental  agreement or lease agreement for such lessee  containing  the  name  and  address  previously  furnished to the bureau. In the event that a lessor  shall fail to rebut the presumption established by this subdivision, the  lessor shall be liable for the fines imposed pursuant  to  this  article  and  in  accordance  with  the  rules and regulations promulgated by the  bureau.    h. The bureau shall by rules and regulations prescribe the manner  and  method of giving notice of outstanding violations to the lessees, except  that  notices  of impending default judgment shall be forwarded by first  class mail, in accordance with subdivision two of  section  two  hundred  forty-one  of  this  article.

Stolen vehicles. If any owner of a motor vehicle receives a notice  of violation for a period during which the illegally parked vehicle  was  reported  to  any police department as having been stolen, it shall be a  valid defense to any charge  of  a  parking  violation  that  the  motor  vehicle  had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time the  violation occurred and had not been recovered  by  such  time.  For  the  purposes of asserting the defense provided by this subdivision, it shall  be  sufficient  that a certified copy of the police report of the stolen  vehicle be mailed to the bureau.    * 4.

The complaint unit established under this section shall  accept  complaints  either  in  person  or  by  certified  mail,  return receipt  requested. Each written demand for payment, other than the first  demand  following  issuance  of  the  notice  of  violation,  shall  advise  the  addressee of the existence of the complaint unit and the  procedure  for  submitting  a  complaint.  Upon receipt of a complaint, if in person, or  within ten work days after receipt  of  a  complaint  if  by  mail,  the  complaint  unit  shall  acknowledge  receipt  in  writing and notify the  complainant of the procedure for  further  review.  The  complaint  unit  shall,  within  thirty  days after receiving a complaint in person or by  certified mail supported by the proof prescribed by this section, notify  the complainant that the payment has been credited to his or her record;  that the wrongful imposition has been  removed  from  the  complainant's  record;  or  that the information sent to the bureau fails to prove that  the fine or penalty was satisfied or that the imposition  was  wrongful,  in which case the reason or reasons shall be set forth.    (b)  If,  after this thirty day period, the bureau continues to demand  payment from this person of the fine or penalty previously satisfied  or  wrongfully  imposed,  or  if the bureau does not render a determination,  the person within six months from the date of his or her complaint shall  have  the  right  to  an  expedited  review  before  a  panel  of  three  administrative  law judges.  Such panel shall be empowered to compel the  bureau to produce records and other evidence relevant  and  material  to  the  complaint.  The  complainant  shall be required to submit, together  with his or her request for a  review,  a  copy  of  all  the  materials  submitted  with  the original complaint. The panel of administrative law  judges shall be  empowered  to  direct  that  the  bureau's  records  be  changed,  as  appropriate,  to insure that no further demand is made for  the fine or penalty previously satisfied or wrongfully imposed, and  the  bureau   shall  comply  with  such  directive.  Further,  the  panel  of  administrative law judges, upon petition by the complainant, may at  its  sole  discretion,  direct  the  parking  violations  bureau  to  pay the  complainant who receives a wrongfully imposed  fine  or  has  previously  satisfied  an  outstanding fine such out-of-pocket expenses as the panel  deems reasonable only in such cases where the  complainant  sufficiently  demonstrates  that  he  or  she  has  notified  the bureau of his or her  complaint under this section and the bureau has failed, in  the  panel's  opinion,  to  remove  the  wrongfully  imposed  fine  or  the previously  satisfied fine; however, payment of such expenses shall not  exceed  the  amount of the original fine.

Such  information shall also be published annually and placed in the municipal  reference library, in such cities where applicable.    4.  The  proof  that  must be submitted in connection with a complaint  made under this section is, as appropriate, a copy of the receipt, money  order or front and back of cancelled check; a copy of a police report of  stolen vehicle or stolen or lost plates or proof of an insurance company  payment for a stolen vehicle, or a department of motor vehicles  receipt  for  surrendered plates.

VAT250,"Vehicle and Traffic      250. Exemption  of  non-resident  owners and operators. 1. Except as  otherwise provided in subdivision three of this section, the  provisions  of  this  chapter  relative  to  the registration and equipment of motor  vehicles, motorcycles and  trailers  and  the  display  of  registration  numbers  shall not apply to a motor vehicle, motorcycle or trailer owned  by a non-resident of this state, provided that the owner  thereof  shall  have  complied  with  the  provisions of the law of the foreign country,  state, territory or  federal  district  of  his  residence  relative  to  registration and equipment of such motor vehicle, motorcycle or trailer,  as the case may be, and the display of registration numbers thereon, and  shall   conspicuously  display  his  registration  numbers  as  required  thereby. However, except for  a  vehicle  owned  by  a  person  who  has  obtained  a  waiver  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  paragraph  b  of  subdivision three of this section, with respect  to  such  vehicle,  the  provisions of this subdivision shall be operative as to a motor vehicle,  motorcycle  or trailer owned by a non-resident of this state only to the  extent that under the laws of the foreign country, state,  territory  or  federal  district  of  his  residence like exemptions and privileges are  granted to motor vehicles,  motorcycles  and  trailers  duly  registered  under  the laws of and owned by residents of this state. A person, firm,  association or corporation having a  place  of  business  in  a  foreign  country,  state,  territory  or  federal  district  and  owning  a motor  vehicle, motorcycle or trailer used in connection with  and  garaged  at  such place of business which such owner is compelled to register in such  foreign  jurisdiction  shall  be  deemed  a  resident  of  such  foreign  jurisdiction and a non-resident of this state within the meaning of this  subdivision  for  the  purpose  of  enjoying  the  privileges  of   this  subdivision with respect to such vehicle.    In  case  a non-resident becomes a resident of this state, he shall be  entitled for a period not exceeding thirty days from the date he becomes  a resident to the same exemption from registering his vehicles  in  this  state as he would have enjoyed had he remained a non-resident.    2.  A  person  of  the age of sixteen years and upwards who shall be a  nonresident of this state, and a resident of a state, territory, federal  district or foreign country having laws,  with  which  such  person  has  complied, which require such person, in order to operate a motor vehicle  or  motorcycle  therein,  to  be  licensed, may operate or drive a motor  vehicle or motorcycle on the public highways of this state without being  so licensed under this chapter, provided, however, that the  recognition  granted under this subdivision shall, with respect to a person under the  age  of  eighteen years, only permit the operation of a motor vehicle or  motorcycle in this  state  in  accordance  with  the  same  restrictions  imposed  upon  New York residents operating or driving motor vehicles or  motorcycles with class DJ or MJ  licenses  under  subdivision  three  of  section  five  hundred  one  of  this chapter. A nonresident entitled to  operate a motor vehicle or  motorcycle  as  herein  provided  who  shall  become  a resident of this state may operate or drive a motor vehicle or  motorcycle on the public  highways  of  this  state  for  a  period  not  exceeding  thirty  days  from the date he becomes a resident pending the  obtaining of a license to operate such motor vehicle  or  motorcycle  in  this state. The exemption granted in this subdivision shall not apply to  persons  whose  privilege of operating a motor vehicle in this state, or  whose former license to drive in  this  state,  has  been  suspended  or  revoked,  until  such  suspension  or  revocation has been terminated or  privilege of operating a motor vehicle restored.    3. (a) The exemptions provided in subdivisions one and  four  of  this  section shall not apply to a motor vehicle, motorcycle or trailer, other  than  a semitrailer drawn by a tractor registered in this state which is  operated on any public highway of this state  to  transport  persons  or  property  for  hire  or  profit  from one point in this state to another  point in this state or which is operated in  doing  any  work  performed  under  a  contract  for  a  public  improvement  to  which  the state, a  municipal corporation, a  school  district  or  a  commission  appointed  pursuant  to  law  is  a  party, except to transport machinery, tools or  other plant equipment to be used in the performance of such a  contract;  provided,  however,  that the mere makeup or breakup of a tandem trailer  combination on the New York state thruway shall not, with respect to the  tractor hauling such tandem trailer combination, constitute, in  and  of  itself,  a  point  in  this state for the purpose of determining whether  there has been a transportation of property for hire or profit from  one  point  in  this state to another point in this state; provided, further,  however, that the transportation by any tractor not  registered  in  the  state  of  New  York  of  a trailer carrying property for profit, placed  thereon within this state and consigned for delivery  herein,  shall  be  prohibited.    (b)  The  commissioner may, in his discretion, waive the provisions of  this subdivision with respect to any motor vehicle, motorcycle,  trailer  or  semitrailer,  duly  registered  in another state, territory, federal  district or  foreign  country,  provided  that  the  owner  thereof  has  registered  annually  in  this state a number of vehicles equal to or in  excess of the average number of vehicles said owner will have  available  annually  in  this state for hire or operation therein. The commissioner  is hereby  authorized  and  empowered  to  adopt  and  amend  rules  and  regulations  to  effectuate  the  provisions  of  this  paragraph.  Such  regulations may include a requirement that the owner file  annually  and  at  such  time  and  in  such  manner  as  shall  be  prescribed  by the  commissioner, a sworn  statement  including,  but  not  limited  to  the  following  information:  (1) the owner's total number of motor vehicles,  motorcycles, trailers and/or semitrailers registered in Canada  and  the  United  States;  (2)  the  owner's  total  annual  registration  of such  vehicles in this state; and (3) the total number of such vehicles  which  are  rented, leased or used in this state for the preceding twelve month  period or in the absence of any past experience, the  total  anticipated  number  of  such  vehicles  that  will be rented, leased or used in this  state. Nothing herein contained shall  be  construed  as  requiring  the  granting of the waiver authorized by this paragraph.    (c)  The  provisions  of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, insofar as  they require display of number plates issued by the commissioner,  shall  not  apply  to  any  motor  vehicle,  other  than  a  bus, which is duly  registered in another state and displays registration and number  plates  as  required  by that state, which registration and number plates permit  the transportation of persons for-hire within that state,  provided  the  registrant  has been issued a registration for such motor vehicle by the  commissioner, has  paid  the  appropriate  annual  fee  as  provided  in  schedule  C  of  subdivision  seven  of section four hundred one of this  chapter and displays proof of  such  registration  on  such  vehicle  in  accordance   with   regulations   promulgated   by   the   commissioner.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this  chapter,  the  commissioner  need   not  issue  number  plates  to  the  registrant  when  issuing  a  registration intended to secure the authorization for  operation  within  this state as provided by this paragraph.    4.  a.  The provisions of this chapter relative to the registration of  motor vehicles, motorcycles and trailers and the display of registration  numbers shall not apply to a motor vehicle, motorcycle or trailer  owned  by  a  non-resident  of  the state who is a seasonal farm laborer, for a  period extending from the first  day  of  April  to  and  including  the  thirtieth  day of November in each year, provided that the owner thereof  shall have complied with the  provisions  of  the  law  of  the  foreign  country,  state, territory or federal district of his residence relative  to  registration  of  such  motor vehicle, motorcycle or trailer, as the  case may be, and  the  display  of  registration  numbers  thereof,  and  provided  further  that  the  owner  thereof  shall furnish proof to the  commissioner that such owner has in effect with respect  to  such  motor  vehicle  an  automobile  liability policy issued by an insurance company  authorized to do business in this state or by  an  unauthorized  insurer  authorized  to transact business in the jurisdiction of his residence in  at least the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars  because  of  bodily  injury  to  or  fifty thousand dollars because of death of one person in  any one accident and, subject to said limit for one person, in at  least  the  amount of fifty thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or one  hundred thousand dollars because of death of two or more persons in  any  accident,  and in at least the amount of ten thousand dollars because of  injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident.    b. Upon filing of such proof of financial security,  the  commissioner  shall  issue  to the owner of said motor vehicle, motorcycle or trailer,  upon payment of a fee of two dollars, a certificate,  which  certificate  shall  be  affixed  to  a  prominent place on the interior of said motor  vehicle,  motorcycle  or  trailer,  and   shall   bear   the   following  information:  (1)  name  and address of the owner of said motor vehicle,  motorcycle or  trailer,  (2)  make  and  year  of  said  motor  vehicle,  motorcycle or trailer, (3) state of registration and registration number  thereof, (4) date of expiration of the exemption period provided in this  subdivision  and  (5)  such  other  information  as the commissioner may  direct.    c. The exemption provided in this subdivision shall in no  way  affect  the  non-resident  status of the owner of said motor vehicle, motorcycle  or trailer and he shall be subject to the provisions of all other  laws,  rules,  codes  and  regulations  with  respect  to  the ownership and/or  operation by a non-resident of a motor vehicle, motorcycle or trailer in  this state. However, all said motor vehicles, motorcycles  and  trailers  shall  be  subject  to the provisions of article five of this chapter in  the same manner as if they are registered in this state.    d. A non-resident of the state who is a seasonal farm laborer shall be  entitled to a period not exceeding thirty days  from  the  date  of  his  entrance into the state within which to file proof of financial security  and  pay  the  fee  required  and  secure  the certificate authorized in  paragraph b of subdivision four of this section, provided, however, that  the limitations contained in subdivision three of this section shall  be  applicable  until such time as the certificate authorized in paragraph b  of this subdivision is obtained.    5.  As  used  in  this  section,  the  term  ""resident""   shall   mean  domiciliary,  that is, one who lives in this state with the intention of  making it a fixed and permanent abode. It shall be presumptive  evidence  that  a person who maintains a place of abode in this state for a period  of at least ninety days is a resident of this state."

A member of the armed forces who  has  been  issued  a  license  to  operate  a motor vehicle or motorcycle by the armed forces of the United  States may operate a motor vehicle or motorcycle on the public  highways  of  this state without being licensed under this chapter for a period of  sixty days after such person has entered this state.    3. The provisions of this chapter relative  to  the  registration  and  equipment of motor vehilces, motorcycles and trailers and the display of  registration  numbers  shall not apply to motor vehicles, motorcycles or  trailers owned by members of the armed forces or  their  dependents  who  are  non-residents  of this state, provided that the owner thereof shall  have complied with the provisions of the law  of  the  foreign  country,  state,  territory  or  federal  district  of  his  residence relative to  registration and  equipment  of  such  motor  vehicles,  motorcycles  or  trailers,  as  the  case may be, and the display of registration numbers  thereon, and shall conspicuously display  his  registration  numbers  as  required thereby.    4.

The use or operation by  a  non-resident  of  a vehicle in this state, or the use or operation in  this state of a vehicle in the business of a non-resident, or the use or  operation in this state of a vehicle owned by a non-resident if so  used  or  operated  with  his  permission, express or implied, shall be deemed  equivalent to an appointment by such non-resident of  the  secretary  of  state  to  be  his  true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served the  summons in any action against  him,  growing  out  of  any  accident  or  collision  in  which  such  non-resident  may be involved while using or  operating such vehicle in this state or in which  such  vehicle  may  be  involved  while  being used or operated in this state in the business of  such non-resident or with the permission, express or  implied,  of  such  non-resident  owner;  and  such  use  or  operation  shall  be  deemed a  signification of his agreement that any such summons against  him  which  is  so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served  on  him  personally  within  the  state  and  within   the   territorial  jurisdiction  of  the court from which the summons issues, and that such  appointment of the secretary of state shall be irrevocable  and  binding  upon  his  executor  or  administrator. Where such non-resident has died  prior to the commencement of an action brought pursuant to this section,  service of process shall be made on the  executor  or  administrator  of  such  non-resident  in  the  same  manner  and  on the same notice as is  provided in the case of the non-resident himself. Where  an  action  has  been  duly  commenced  under  the  provisions  of this section against a  non-resident who dies thereafter, the court must allow the action to  be  continued  against  his  executor or administrator upon motion with such  notice as the court deems proper.    2. A summons in an action described in this section may issue  in  any  court  in  the  state  having  jurisdiction of the subject matter and be  served as hereinafter provided. Service of such summons shall be made by  mailing a copy thereof to the secretary of state at his  office  in  the  city of Albany, or by personally delivering a copy thereof to one of his  regularly  established  offices,  with  a  fee  of ten dollars, and such  service shall be sufficient service upon such non-resident provided that  notice of such service and a copy  of  the  summons  and  complaint  are  forthwith  sent  by  or  on  behalf of the plaintiff to the defendant by  certified mail or registered mail with  return  receipt  requested.  The  plaintiff  shall file with the clerk of the court in which the action is  pending, or with the judge or justice of such court in case there be  no  clerk,  an  affidavit  of compliance herewith, a copy of the summons and  complaint, and either a return receipt purporting to be  signed  by  the  defendant  or  a  person  qualified  to  receive  his  certified mail or  registered mail, in  accordance  with  the  rules  and  customs  of  the  post-office  department;  or, if acceptance was refused by the defendant  or his agent, the original envelope bearing a  notation  by  the  postal  authorities  that  receipt was refused, and an affidavit by or on behalf  of the plaintiff that notice of such mailing and refusal  was  forthwith  sent  to  the  defendant  by  ordinary  mail;  or,  if the registered or  certified letter was returned to the post office unclaimed, the original  envelope bearing a notation by the postal authorities  of  such  mailing  and  return,  an  affidavit  by  or  on behalf of the plaintiff that the  summons  was  posted  again  by  ordinary  mail  and  proof  of  mailing  certificate  of  ordinary mail. Where the summons is mailed to a foreign  country, other official proof of the delivery of the mail may  be  filed  in  case  the  post-office  department is unable to obtain such a return  receipt. The foregoing papers shall be filed within  thirty  days  after  the  return  receipt or other official proof of delivery or the original  envelope bearing a notation of refusal, as the case may be, is  received  by  the plaintiff. Service of process shall be complete when such papers  are filed. The return receipt or other official proof of delivery  shall  constitute  presumptive evidence that the summons mailed was received by  the  defendant  or  a  person qualified to receive his certified mail or  registered  mail;  and  the  notation  of   refusal   shall   constitute  presumptive evidence that the refusal was by the defendant or his agent.  Service  of  such  summons also may be made by mailing a copy thereof to  the secretary of state at his office  in  the  city  of  Albany,  or  by  personally delivering a copy thereof to one of his regularly established  offices,  with  a fee of ten dollars, and by delivering a duplicate copy  thereof with the complaint annexed thereto, to the defendant  personally  without the state by a resident or citizen of the state of New York or a  sheriff,  under-sheriff,  deputy-sheriff  or  constable of the county or  other political subdivision in which the personal service is made, or an  officer authorized by the laws of this state, to  take  acknowledgements  of  deeds  to be recorded in this state, or an attorney and/or counselor  at law, solicitor, advocate or barrister duly qualified to  practice  in  the  state  or country where such service is made, or by a United States  marshall or deputy United States marshall.  Proof  of  personal  service  without  the  state  shall be filed with the clerk of the court in which  the action is pending within thirty days after  such  service.  Personal  service  without  the state is complete when proof thereof is filed. The  court in which the action is pending may order such extensions as may be  necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to  defend  the  action.    3.  As  used  in  this  section,  the  term  ""vehicle""  means a ""motor  vehicle,"" ""motorcycle,""  ""semitrailer,""  and  ""trailer""  as  defined  in  sections  one hundred twenty-five, one hundred twenty-three, one hundred  forty-three and one hundred fifty-six, respectively,  of  this  chapter,  whether or not such vehicles are used or operated upon a public highway."

(2) Such inspection may also include a visual inspection prescribed by  the commissioner to determine the presence and correct  installation  of  any  air  contaminant  emission systems or devices which are required by  state or federal law or  any  rules  or  regulations  pursuant  thereto;  provided  that  for  any  vehicle  not subject to an emission inspection  pursuant to subdivision (d) of  this  section,  such  visual  inspection  shall be performed.    (3)  Improper  tire  pressure  shall  not be reason for failure of the  inspection.    (d) (1) The commissioner, in consultation  with  the  commissioner  of  environmental  conservation,  shall implement a program of motor vehicle  emissions inspections with respect to any motor  vehicles  or  class  of  motor  vehicles  which  are  required  by  federal  law  or any rules or  regulations issued pursuant thereto or by any state law or any rules  or  regulations  issued  pursuant  thereto,  including rules and regulations  issued  by  the  department  of  environmental  conservation,  to   meet  standards  applicable  to  the emission of any kind of substance by such  vehicles  or  engines  or  to  contain  any equipment, systems or design  features to reduce  such  emission.  The  commissioner  shall  establish  regulations   for  such  inspections.  Such  regulations  shall  include  provision  for  cooperating  with  the  commissioner  of   environmental  conservation  to  notify  owners  of  vehicles that have failed emission  inspections of the availability  of  mobile  source  emission  reduction  credit trading programs pursuant to section 19-0301 of the environmental  conservation law.    (2)  Such  inspection  shall be performed biennially; provided however  that the commissioner may require emission inspections  more  frequently  than  biennially  if  the commissioner of environmental conservation, in  consultation with the commissioner,  makes  a  determination  that  more  frequent  emission  inspections  are  necessary  to  comply with federal  requirements or a court order; and provided that an emission  inspection  program  in  operation  prior  to  nineteen  hundred  ninety-three shall  continue to require emission inspections at least annually until January  first, nineteen hundred ninety-six.    (3) Such inspection  shall  be  performed  at  a  facility  that  only  performs  inspections if the commissioner of environmental conservation,  in consultation with the commissioner, makes a determination  that  such  restriction is necessary to meet federal requirements. In no event shall  any  facility  operating  pursuant  to a contract with the commissioner,  entered into pursuant to subdivision (a) of section three hundred  three  of  this  chapter, be allowed to perform repairs; provided however, that  such a facility shall be allowed to perform repairs at  no  charge  that  are incidental to the inspection process.    (4)  The  commissioner  shall  establish  an  emission  system  repair  training program, for purposes of enhancing the quality and  reliability  of  emission  system  repair  services  available  from  official repair  stations in all areas where emission inspections are required under this  section.    (e) The requirements of air contamination emission  system  inspection  shall  not  apply  to  historical  motor vehicles registered pursuant to  schedule G of subdivision seven of section  four  hundred  one  of  this  chapter unless required by federal law.    (f) The department is authorized, in consultation with the departments  of  environmental  conservation  and  transportation, to adopt rules and  regulations necessary to  implement  a  heavy  duty  vehicle  inspection  program  pursuant  to  section 19-0320 of the environmental conservation  law  and  implement  such  program  by  June  first,  nineteen   hundred  ninety-nine."

The  commissioner  may  require  that  a  motor  vehicle  registered in this state or elsewhere which is required to be inspected,  be re-inspected after it is involved in a property damage accident which  is  required  to  be  reported  to  the  motor  vehicle department. Such  re-inspection shall be made  within  sixty  days  of  the  date  of  the  accident  if  the  motor  vehicle is driven away from the accident site.  Such re-inspection shall be made before the vehicle is operated  on  the  public  highways  if  the motor vehicle is towed or transported from the  accident site, except that a motor vehicle may be driven from  a  repair  shop to an inspection station for the purpose of being re-inspected.    2.  The  owner  of a car so damaged shall be required to submit to the  department within the same time limit as provided in subdivision one  of  this  section  satisfactory proof of re-inspection pursuant to rules and  regulations to be promulgated by the commissioner.    3.

(b)  Each  official  inspection  station  shall  keep  a   record   of  inspections,  re-inspections,  and  the results thereof, and a record of  certificates of inspection issued.    (c) Each official inspection station shall prominently display  in  an  area  of  the  station where the orderly transaction of business of such  station occurs a sign provided or approved by the department and,  after  a  motor  vehicle  fails  to  pass  inspection  at such station, provide  written notice on forms provided or approved by the  department  to  the  owner  or  person  in  charge of said vehicle that the necessary repairs  must  be  made  to  the  vehicle  within  thirty  days  from the date of  inspection and that such repairs need not necessarily be  made  at  that  station  and  shall  be made in a manner consistent with federal law and  regulations.  The  period  allowed  for  repair  shall  not  extend  the  expiration  date  of  either  the  inspection  sticker  or  registration  certificate.    (d) 1. The commissioner shall supervise and cause  inspections  to  be  made  of  such official inspection stations.

(e)  A  license  to  operate  an  official  inspection  station  or  a  certificate  to  inspect vehicles may be suspended or revoked or renewal  thereof may be refused by the commissioner or any person duly  deputized  for one or more of the following causes:    1.  Failure  to conduct inspections in conformance with the provisions  of this article and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder  or  improper issuance of certificates of inspections.    2. Conviction of a crime involving fraud, theft, perjury or bribery or  other cause which would permit disqualification from receiving a license  or a certificate to inspect vehicles upon the original application.    3.  Fraud,  deceit  or  misrepresentation in securing the license or a  certificate to inspect  vehicles  or  in  the  conduct  of  licensed  or  certified activity.    4.  Excessive  charges  for  conducting  inspections  and  for  making  adjustments, corrections or repairs required by such inspections.    5. Violation  of  any  provision  of  this  article  or  any  rule  or  regulation promulgated thereunder.    (f)  No  license  or  certificate  shall  be  revoked or suspended, or  renewal refused,  except  upon  notice  to  the  licensee  or  certified  inspector   and   after  an  opportunity  to  be  heard.  A  license  or  certificate, however, may be temporarily suspended upon a written notice  of temporary suspension delivered by certified mail to the  licensee  or  certified  inspector  pending any prosecution, investigation or hearing.  The written notice  of  temporary  suspension  shall  provide  that  the  temporary  suspension  is  effective seventy-two hours after delivery of  such notice. Whenever any license  to  operate  an  official  inspection  station  or  certificate  to  inspect vehicles is revoked, no license or  certificate shall be reissued to an applicant until after the expiration  of a period of one year from the date of such revocation.    (g) Upon the revocation or suspension of an inspection station license  or certificate to inspect vehicles, the  holder  thereof  shall  deliver  such  license  or  certificate  to  the  revoking or suspending officer,  together with all inspection and inspection extension certificates,  all  inspection  record  forms, and any and all other items in the possession  of  the  license or certificate holder which theretofore had been issued  by the commissioner for use in connection with the inspection station or  the inspection of vehicles. The failure of the holder thereof to deliver  any of the aforesaid items to the revoking or suspending officer, or  to  any  peace  officer,  acting  pursuant  to his special duties, or police  officer directed by the  commissioner  or  agent  of  the  commissioner,  displaying  authorization to act in such capacity along with a certified  copy of  the  order  revoking  or  suspending  such  inspection  station  license, to secure possession thereof, shall constitute a misdemeanor.    (h)  The commissioner, or any person duly deputized, in addition to or  in lieu of revoking or suspending  a  license  to  operate  an  official  inspection  station  or  a certificate to inspect vehicles, may by order  require the licensee or certified inspector to pay to the people of this  state a penalty for a first violation a sum not exceeding seven  hundred  and  fifty  dollars for each violation found to have been committed; and  for a second or  subsequent  violation  not  arising  out  of  the  same  incident  both of which were committed within a period of thirty months,  a sum of not more than one thousand dollars for each violation found  to  have  been  committed;  provided,  however, the penalty for each and any  violation of paragraph three of subdivision (e) of this section found to  have been committed shall be  no  less  than  three  hundred  and  fifty  dollars  and  no more than one thousand dollars, and upon the failure of  such licensee to pay such penalty within twenty days after  the  mailing  of  such  order, postage prepaid, registered or certified, and addressed  to the last known place  of  business  of  such  licensee  or  certified  inspector,  unless  such  order  is  stayed  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction or in accordance with the provisions of Article three-A  of  this  chapter,  the commissioner may revoke the license of such licensee  or the certificate of such certified inspector or may suspend  the  same  for  such  period  as  may be determined. Civil penalties assessed under  this subdivision shall be paid to the commissioner for deposit into  the  state  treasury,  and  unpaid  civil  penalties  may be recovered by the  commissioner in a civil action in  the  name  of  the  commissioner.  In  addition,  as  an  alternative to such civil action and provided that no  proceeding for judicial review shall then be pending and  the  time  for  initiation  of  such proceeding shall have expired, the commissioner may  file with the county clerk of the county  in  which  the  registrant  is  located  or  the  certified  inspector  resides  a  final  order  of the  commissioner containing the amount of the penalty assessed.  The  filing  of  such  final order shall have the full force and effect of a judgment  duly docketed in the office of such clerk and may  be  enforced  in  the  same  manner and with the same effect as that provided by law in respect  to executions issued against property  upon  judgments  of  a  court  of  record.    (i)  The holder of an inspection station license shall remove or cause  to be removed any sign which contains the license number of the  station  which  is visible to the public and which is required to be displayed by  this article or regulations promulgated thereunder  if  the  license  is  revoked  or  suspended  or the inspection station is out of business. If  the license is only suspended, the holder may cover up the sign  instead  of removing it.    (j)  No  person  shall  permit  the display of any sign required to be  displayed  by  this  article  or  regulations   promulgated   thereunder  indicating  to  the  public  that  an  official  inspection  station  is  operating unless an inspection station license has been issued  to  that  person and is currently valid."

If  such  inspection  discloses improper tire pressure, the owner  shall be so notified and  may  have  such  adjustments,  corrections  or  repairs  made  as authorized by this subdivision. The commissioner shall  establish procedures for reporting the results of such  inspections  and  for   notifying  the  owners.  The  owner  may  have  such  adjustments,  corrections and repairs made in any way and by any person provided  that  such  repairs  are  made  in  a  manner  consistent with federal law and  regulations.    (c)  The  commissioner  shall  issue  certificates  of  inspection  to  official  inspection  stations. Such certificates of inspection shall be  serially numbered and shall bear such information  as  the  commissioner  may  require,  and  shall include a notice that any complaint against an  official inspection station for  inadequate  inspection  or  for  making  excessive  or  unreasonable  repairs,  may  be  made  in  writing to the  department of motor vehicles at Albany, New York. Each certificate shall  be valid until the end of the inspection period during which  the  motor  vehicle  must  again  be  inspected,  as  determined  by  the  rules and  regulations of the commissioner, or until the end of the  repair  period  designated under section three hundred four (b), whichever occurs first."

VAT309,"Vehicle and Traffic      309. Legislative  findings.  1.  The  legislature  hereby  finds and  declares that the safety of the motoring  public  depends  on  a  modern  system of periodic motor vehicle inspection.    2.  In  nineteen hundred fifty-nine New York state recognized the need  for inspection of motor vehicles  to  assure  its  citizens  that  their  safety would be protected by removing from its highways those cars whose  mechanical condition did not meet rigid standards of safety.    3.  The  introduction  of  anti-pollution  devices and newly developed  safety attachments to  modern  automobiles  requires  that  experimental  inspection  stations be established to permit the testing of new methods  of periodic motor vehicle inspection.    4. The creation of new techniques of periodic motor vehicle inspection  has become the concern of the federal government, and federal funds  are  now  available  for  the  development  of criteria for modern inspection  methods.   Therefore, legislation  should  be  enacted  to  promote  the  advancement of the periodic motor vehicle inspection program in New York  state."

VAT310,"Vehicle and Traffic      310. Short  title and declaration of purpose. (1) This article shall  be known and may be cited as the ""Motor Vehicle Financial Security Act.""    (2) Declaration of purpose. The  legislature  is  concerned  over  the  rising  toll  of  motor  vehicle  accidents  and  the suffering and loss  thereby inflicted. The legislature determines that it  is  a  matter  of  grave  concern  that  motorists  shall be financially able to respond in  damages for their negligent acts, so  that  innocent  victims  of  motor  vehicle  accidents  may be recompensed for the injury and financial loss  inflicted upon them.  The legislature finds and declares that the public  interest can best be served in satisfying the insurance requirements  of  this  article by private enterprise operating in a competitive market to  provide proof of  financial  security  through  the  methods  prescribed  herein.    Nothing in this article shall be construed to affect any change in the  application  of  article twenty-three of the insurance law to automobile  liability insurance rate-making or to effect the development of  various  methods   of  doing  or  operating  an  automobile  liability  insurance  business."

Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  any  law   or  regulation, any proof of financial security shall for any self-propelled  motor  vehicle  also  provide  coverage  required by this article to any  non-commercial trailer hauled by any such motor vehicle,  other  than  a  mobile  home.  For  the  purposes  of  this  article,  a  mobile home or  ""manufactured home"" means a mobile home or manufactured home as  defined  in section one hundred twenty-two-c of this chapter.    4.  The  term  ""owner's  policy  of  liability insurance"" shall mean a  policy    (a) Affording coverage as defined in the minimum provisions prescribed  in a regulation which shall be  promulgated  by  the  superintendent  at  least   ninety   days   prior   to  effective  date  of  this  act.  The  superintendent before promulgating such  regulations  or  any  amendment  thereof,  shall  consult  with all insurers licensed to write automobile  liability insurance in  this  state  and  shall  not  prescribe  minimum  provisions  which fail to reflect the provisions of automobile liability  insurance policies, other  than  motor  vehicle  liability  policies  as  defined  in  section  three  hundred  forty-five of this chapter, issued  within this state at the date of such regulation or  amendment  thereof.  Nothing  contained  in such regulation or in this article shall prohibit  any insurer from affording coverage under an owner's policy of liability  insurance more liberal than that required by  said  minimum  provisions.  Every such owner's policy of liability insurance shall provide insurance  subject  to  said  regulation against loss from the liability imposed by  law for damages, including  damages  for  care  and  loss  of  services,  because  of  bodily  injury  to  or death of any person and injury to or  destruction of property arising out of the ownership, maintenance,  use,  or  operation  of  a specific motor vehicle or motor vehicles within the  state of New York, or elsewhere in the United States in North America or  the Dominion of Canada, subject to a limit, exclusive  of  interest  and  costs,  with  respect  to each such motor vehicle except a tow truck, of  twenty-five thousand dollars because of bodily  injuries  to  and  fifty  thousand dollars because of death of one person in any one accident and,  subject  to  said  limit  for  one  person, to a limit of fifty thousand  dollars because of bodily injury to and  one  hundred  thousand  dollars  because  of  death  of two or more persons in any one accident, and to a  limit of ten thousand dollars because of injury  to  or  destruction  of  property  of  others  in  any  one accident provided, however, that such  policy need not be for a period coterminous with the registration period  of the vehicle insured. The limit, exclusive of interest and costs, with  respect to a tow truck shall be a combined  single  limit  of  at  least  three  hundred thousand dollars because of bodily injury or death to one  or  more  persons  or  because  of  injury or destruction of property of  others in any one accident, and  to  a  limit  of  twenty-five  thousand  dollars  because of damage to a vehicle in the care, custody and control  of the insured. Any insurer authorized to issue  an  owner's  policy  of  liability  insurance  as  provided  for in this article may, pending the  issue of such a policy, make an agreement, to be known as a  binder,  or  may,  in  lieu of such a policy, issue a renewal endorsement or evidence  of renewal of an existing policy; each of which shall  be  construed  to  provide indemnity or protection in like manner and to the same extent as  such  a  policy.  The  provisions  of  this  article shall apply to such  binders, renewal endorsements or evidences of renewal. Every such policy  issued insuring private passenger vehicles  and  every  renewal  policy,  renewal  endorsement,  or  other  evidence  of renewal issued shall have  attached thereto a rating information form which clearly  specifies  and  defines  the  rating  classification  assigned  thereto,  including  any  applicable merit rating plan; and    (b) In the case of a vehicle registered in this state, a policy issued  by an insurer duly authorized to transact business in this state; or    (c) In the case of a vehicle lawfully registered in another state,  or  in  both  this  state  and  another  state, either a policy issued by an  authorized insurer, or  a  policy  issued  by  an  unauthorized  insurer  authorized  to  transact  business in another state if such unauthorized  insurer files with the commissioner in form to  be  approved  by  him  a  statement  consenting  to  service of process and declaring its policies  shall be deemed to be varied to comply with  the  requirements  of  this  article; and    (d) The form of which has been approved by the superintendent. No such  policy  shall  be  issued or delivered in this state until a copy of the  form of policy shall have been on file with the  superintendent  for  at  least   thirty   days,   unless   sooner  approved  in  writing  by  the  superintendent,  nor  if  within  said  period  of   thirty   days   the  superintendent  shall  have  notified the carrier in writing that in his  opinion, specifying the reasons therefor, the form of  policy  does  not  comply with the laws of this state.    5.  The term ""certificate of insurance"" shall mean any evidence issued  by or on behalf of an insurance  company  duly  authorized  to  transact  business  in  this  state,  stating in such form as the commissioner may  prescribe or approve that such company has issued an owner's  policy  of  liability insurance on the motor vehicle or vehicles designated therein.  Such   certificate   shall   contain  information  as  required  by  the  commissioner including  at  least  the  following  except  as  otherwise  provided:    (a) The name and address of the person to whom the policy was issued.    (b) The number and effective period of the policy. If all of the motor  vehicles  owned  by one person during a defined period are insured under  the same owner's  policy  of  liability  insurance  the  certificate  of  insurance  may  so  state and it shall then not be necessary to identify  the specific vehicle insured. The requirements of this  article  for  an  owner's  policy  of liability insurance may be fulfilled by the policies  of one or more insurance carriers  which  policies  together  meet  such  requirements.    (c)  As to new policies, a statement that at least ten per cent of the  annual premium due on the policy has been paid. For the purposes of this  paragraph a transfer of insurance from one  company  to  another  by  an  agent or broker shall not be considered the issuance of a new policy.    6.  The  term  ""financial  security  bond""  shall  mean for each motor  vehicle a bond executed by the  owner  and  by  a  surety  company  duly  authorized  to  transact  business  in  this  state.  The  provisions of  subdivision (e) of section three  hundred  forty-nine  of  this  chapter  shall apply to such bond.    7.  The  term  ""financial  security deposit"" shall mean for each motor  vehicle the  deposit  with  the  commissioner  of  twenty-five  thousand  dollars  in  cash,  or  securities,  such as may legally be purchased by  savings banks or trust funds, of a market value of twenty-five  thousand  dollars  and  an  additional  deposit  in  an  amount  determined by the  commissioner to be sufficient to satisfy  the  requirements  of  article  fifty-one of the insurance law.    8.  The  term  ""self-insurer""  shall mean a person who shall have been  determined by the commissioner in accordance with section three  hundred  sixteen to be financially responsible.    9. The word ""state"" when used in this article shall unless the context  clearly  indicates otherwise, mean any state, territory or possession of  the United States, the District of  Columbia  or  any  province  of  the  Dominion of Canada.    10.  ""Insurance Identification Card"" shall mean a card issued by or on  behalf of an insurance company or bonding  company  duly  authorized  to  transact   business   in  this  state,  stating  in  such  form  as  the  commissioner may prescribe or approve that such company  has  issued  an  owner's  policy  of  liability insurance or a financial security bond on  the motor vehicle  or  vehicles  designated  therein.  Such  card  shall  contain such information and shall be valid during such period as may be  prescribed by the commissioner. If an owner shall have filed a financial  security  deposit,  or  shall  have  qualified  as  a self-insurer under  section three hundred sixteen  of  this  chapter,  the  term  ""insurance  identification  card""  shall  mean a card issued by the department which  evidences that such deposit has been filed or that  such  owner  has  so  qualified."
VAT312,"Vehicle and Traffic      312. Registration  of  motor vehicles. 1. (a) No motor vehicle shall  be registered in this state unless the application for such registration  is accompanied by proof of financial security which shall  be  evidenced  by  proof  of  insurance  or  evidence  of  a financial security bond, a  financial security deposit or  qualification  as  a  self-insurer  under  section  three hundred sixteen; provided that, if directed by regulation  of  the  commissioner,  upon  renewal  of  registration  an  application  accompanied  by  a  certificate of registration or renewal stub in force  immediately preceding the date of application for renewal, together with  a statement in a form prescribed by  the  commissioner  certifying  that  there  is  in  effect  proof  of  financial  security,  shall  meet  the  requirements of this section. Upon the issuance or renewal of a  private  passenger  automobile  insurance  policy  subject  to  the provisions of  section one hundred sixty-seven-aa of the insurance law,  the  insurance  company  shall  provide  the  insured  with  an  informational statement  outlining the legal and  financial  consequences  of  convictions  under  section  one thousand one hundred ninety-two of this chapter, pertaining  to operating a motor vehicle while under the  influence  of  alcohol  or  drugs.  Such  information  shall be supplied to the company by the state  department of financial services in consultation with the commissioner.    (b) The owner of such motor vehicle shall maintain proof of  financial  security continuously throughout the registration period and his failure  to  produce  proof  of  financial  security when requested to do so upon  demand of a magistrate, motor vehicle inspector, peace  officer,  acting  pursuant to his special duties, or police officer, while such vehicle is  being operated upon the public highway, shall be presumptive evidence of  operating  a motor vehicle without proof of financial security. Upon the  production of proof of financial security such presumption  is  removed.  Production  of  proof  of financial security may be made by mailing such  proof to the court having jurisdiction in the matter, and any  necessary  response  by  such  court  or  acknowledgement of the production of such  proof may also be made by mail. When insurance with respect to any motor  vehicle,  other  than  a  motorcycle,  is  terminated  the  owner  shall  surrender  forthwith  his  registration certificate and number plates of  the vehicle to the  commissioner  unless  proof  of  financial  security  otherwise is maintained in compliance with this article.    2.  No  financial  security bond shall be accepted by the commissioner  unless it is conditioned for payments in amount and under the same terms  and conditions as are  required  for  an  owner's  policy  of  liability  insurance.    3. No financial security deposit shall be accepted by the commissioner  except  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section three hundred  fourteen.    4. The commissioner is  hereby  authorized  to  promulgate  reasonable  regulations  to  provide effective administration and enforcement of the  provisions of this article in accordance with the purposes thereof.    5. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of  this  article,  the  commissioner may by regulation, in lieu of the provisions of subdivision  one  requiring  the submission of a certificate of insurance or evidence  of a financial security bond, require that an  insurance  identification  card be presented each time a vehicle is registered or a registration is  renewed in this state."

No  contract  of  insurance  for  which a certificate of insurance has been filed with the commissioner in  which  a  natural  person  is the named insured and the motor vehicle is  used predominantly for non-business purposes shall be non-renewed by  an  insurer  unless  at  least  forty-five,  but not more than sixty days in  advance of the renewal date the insurer mails or delivers to  the  named  insured  at  the  address  shown  on  the policy a written notice of its  intention not to renew. No such contract of insurance in which the named  insured  is  not  a  natural  person  or  the  motor  vehicle  is   used  predominantly  for  business purposes shall be non-renewed by an insurer  unless at least twenty days in advance of the renewal date  the  insurer  mails  or  delivers  to  the  named  insured at the address shown on the  policy a written notice of its intention not to renew.  All  notices  of  non-renewal shall be sent by regular mail with a certificate of mailing,  properly  endorsed  by  the  postal  service to be obtained. Time of the  effective date and hour of termination stated in the notice shall become  the end of  the  policy  period.  Every  notice  or  acknowledgement  of  termination  for  any cause whatsoever sent to the insured shall include  in type of which the face shall not  be  smaller  than  twelve  point  a  statement  that proof of financial security is required to be maintained  continuously throughout the registration period and a notice  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  indicating  the  punitive  effects  of failure to  maintain continuous proof of financial security and actions which may be  taken by the insured to avoid such punitive effects.    (b) Every insurer shall retain a copy of  the  notice  of  termination  mailed  pursuant  to  this  chapter  and shall retain the certificate of  mailing obtained from  the  postal  service  upon  the  mailing  of  the  original  of  said  notice.  A  copy  of a notice of termination and the  certificate of mailing, when kept in the regular course of the insurer's  business, shall constitute  conclusive  proof  of  compliance  with  the  mailing requirements of this chapter.    2.  (a)  Upon  the  termination  of  an  owner's  policy  of liability  insurance, other than an owner's policy of  liability  insurance  for  a  motorcycle,  at  the  request  of  the insured or by cancellation by the  insurer, the insurer shall file a notice of termination  with  reference  to such policy, as opposed to any insured vehicle or vehicles under such  policy,  with  the commissioner not later than thirty days following the  effective date of such cancellation or other termination, in  accordance  with  the  regulations required by paragraph (c) of this subdivision. An  insurer shall not file a notice of  termination  with  the  commissioner  except as required by this subdivision.    (b)  Upon the issuance of an owner's policy of liability insurance the  insurer shall file a notice or confirmation of issuance  with  reference  to such policy not later than fourteen days following the effective date  of  such issuance, and not later than seven days following the effective  date for policies issued after  January  first,  two  thousand  one,  in  accordance  with  the  regulations  required  by  paragraph  (c) of this  subdivision.    (c)   The   commissioner  shall  promulgate  regulations  establishing  procedures for issuance of proof  of  insurance  and  for  reporting  by  insurers   of   notices  of  termination  and  policy  issuance,  either  electronically or by paper copy, at the option of the  department.  Such  reporting  shall be required for every cancellation or termination which  is effective on or after July first, nineteen  hundred  eighty-four  and  for  every policy issuance which is effective on or after January first,  two thousand; provided, however,  that  should  the  commissioner  find,  after  testing  of  reporting  procedures,  that it would be feasible to  require reporting for policy cancellations,  terminations  or  issuances  effective  on an earlier date, he may by regulation so require reporting  on such earlier date, but in no event shall reporting  be  required  for  cancellations   or  terminations  effective  prior  to  February  first,  nineteen hundred eighty-four nor for policy issuances effective prior to  September first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine. Insurers shall  cooperate  fully with the commissioner in any such testing of reporting procedures.    (d)  Upon  application  by an insurer, the commissioner may extend the  period for filing of notices of termination by such insurer  for  up  to  fifteen  days,  and  for  seven  days for policies issued by an insurer.  Extensions shall not be granted unless the insurer demonstrates  to  the  satisfaction  of the commissioner that compliance with the notice period  would result in substantial hardship to the  insurer.  The  commissioner  shall maintain a list of extensions granted pursuant to this paragraph.    3.  A  cancellation  or termination for which notice is required to be  filed with the commissioner pursuant to subdivision two of this  section  shall  not  be  effective  with  respect to persons other than the named  insured and members of the insured's household  until  the  insurer  has  filed  a notice thereof with the commissioner or until another insurance  policy covering the same risk has been procured, except  that  a  notice  filed   with   the   commissioner,  in  the  format  prescribed  by  the  commissioner, within the period prescribed in subdivision  two  of  this  section  shall be effective as of the date certified therein, regardless  of whether a suspension  order  is  issued  pursuant  to  section  three  hundred  eighteen of this article. A receipt from the department stating  that a notice of termination has been filed shall be  deemed  conclusive  evidence   of   such   filing.  An  insurer  shall  cooperate  with  the  commissioner in attempting to identify persons not  in  compliance  with  this article in cases where the information reported by the insurer does  not correspond with records maintained by the department.    4.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  article  to  the  contrary, the commissioner shall establish a pilot program  to  maintain  an  up-to-date  insured  vehicle  identification  database  to assist in  identifying  uninsured  motor  vehicles.   Such   databases   shall   be  implemented  by  the  department pursuant to standards prescribed by the  commissioner or an agent designated by the commissioner which shall seek  technical assistance from affected insurers and the New York  Automobile  Insurance  Plan.  This  program  shall utilize all information collected  pursuant to this section and shall also include the following elements:    (a)  In  addition  to  and  in  conjunction  with  the  provisions  of  subdivision  two  of this section, insurers that write private passenger  or commercial motor vehicle insurance in this state shall also submit to  the department, either electronically or by paper copy, at the option of  the department, information that identifies  those  policies  that  have  been  cancelled,  terminated  or  non-renewed and all policies that have  been issued,  the  date  when  such  insurance  lapses,  and  any  other  information   that  the  commissioner  deems  necessary  to  efficiently  identify  and  track  uninsured  vehicles  in  this  state  such  as   a  policyholder's  address, policy number, vehicle registration number, and  vehicle identification number. The department may exempt from such pilot  program  the  transfer  of  information  on  certain  classifications of  vehicles that are in the opinion of the department generally insured and  which it  is  difficult  to  identify  uninsured  vehicles  within  such  classification, such as large commercial vehicle fleets;    (b)  The  department  shall  forward to each motor vehicle insurer, at  such times as deemed necessary and appropriate by  the  commissioner,  a  listing  of  all  the  registrants the department has on file as insured  with that insurer. Such insurer shall then  review  the  listing  within  thirty days of receipt of the listing and report to the department which  of the registrants the insurer does not insure;    (c)  The commissioner shall, in conjunction with the superintendent of  state police and local law enforcement officials formulate  a  means  to  allow  such  database to be easily accessible to on-duty law enforcement  personnel in the performance of their official duties for the purpose of  verifying whether an operator maintains proper insurance coverage and to  increase compliance with the motor vehicle financial security laws under  this article and article eight of this title;    (d) In developing the mechanism to electronically transfer information  to  the  department,   the   commissioner   shall   consult   with   the  superintendent   of   financial   services   and  insurers  to  adopt  a  standardized system  of  organizing,  recording  and  transferring  such  information  so  as  to  minimize  insurer  administrative expenses. The  commissioner shall to the maximum  extent  possible  utilize  nationally  recognized  electronic  data information systems such as those developed  by the American National Standards Institute or the American Association  of Motor Vehicle Administrators;    (e)(1) Either simultaneously or after the up-dated database system has  been established, the commissioner shall develop  a  computer  indicator  that  can be imprinted on a vehicle registration sticker or on a sticker  to be affixed to the insured's  license  plate.  Such  indicator  system  shall enable law enforcement personnel and other authorized persons when  acting in the course of their official duties to access the department's  database  so  that  such  persons  can  ascertain  whether  a vehicle is  properly insured or not insured;    (2) Such computer indicator system shall enable authorized persons  in  the  performance  of their official duties to access information such as  the registrant's name, vehicle identification number, name  of  insurer,  current  status  of  insurance,  vehicle  registration  number and other  information that the  commissioner  deems  necessary  to  implement  the  provisions of this section. The commissioner in developing such computer  indicator  system  shall enable authorized persons in the performance of  their official duties to access only such information that is  necessary  to  detect  uninsured  motor  vehicles or accomplish other goals clearly  established and authorized by law. Such computer indicator system  shall  be designed to protect the personal privacy interests of motorists;    (f) The commissioner shall maintain an insured vehicle database system  that  is  accurate  to  within  a period of fourteen days and a computer  indicator system described in paragraph (e) of this  subdivision  within  twenty-four  months  of  the  effective  date of this subdivision and to  within seven days by January first, two thousand one.  The  commissioner  shall submit to the legislature a report within eighteen months from the  date  this  subdivision  takes  effect which outlines the progress being  made to implement such database and  computer  indicator  system.  After  such  database and computer indicator system is established and put into  operation,  the  commissioner  shall   make   recommendations   to   the  legislature to alter, minimize or eliminate the need for the issuance of  insurance identification cards, simplify the requirements to demonstrate  proof  of  financial  security  and  certificate  of insurance currently  required  by  this  article, eliminate the requirement for production of  proof of financial security to accompany applications for  registrations  or  renewals  thereof  provided  that  such  database indicates that the  registrant is insured, and the repeal or modification of  section  three  hundred  twelve-a  of  this  article.  The  commissioner shall also make  recommendations to the legislature to streamline and shorten the  notice  termination  requirements  of  subdivisions  one,  two and three of this  section and section three hundred eighteen of this article. Such  report  shall be submitted to the legislature within twelve months from the date  such database and indicator system has been implemented;    (g)  To  minimize  the  cost  of this program, the commissioner, if he  deems it necessary and prudent, can initially limit the  scope  of  this  project to a select number of vehicle classifications or insurers;    (h)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of law, information obtained  by the department pursuant to this section shall not be disclosed, used,  sold, accessed, utilized in any manner or released by the department  to  any  person,  corporation, or state and local agency, except in response  to a  specific,  individual  request  for  such  information  authorized  pursuant  to the federal driver's privacy protection act (18 U.S.C. 2721  et.seq.). The department shall institute measures to  ensure  that  only  authorized  persons  are  permitted  to  access such information for the  purposes specified by this section. Persons  who  knowingly  release  or  disclose  information  from such database for a purpose other than those  described as authorized by this section or to a person not  entitled  to  receive  it  shall  be  guilty of a misdemeanor for each such release or  disclosure; and    (i)  The  commissioner  may  postpone  implementation  of  such  pilot  database  and  computer  indicator  system  for  a period of time not to  exceed eighteen months if he or she determines that the program  is  not  ready  for  implementation.  Should the commissioner determine that such  system cannot be implemented during the eighteen months extension,  then  the  commissioner  shall  report to the legislature the reasons why such  program cannot be implemented and request that the  law  be  amended  to  delay its implementation date."

All moneys or  securities delivered to the commissioner as a financial security deposit  shall be placed by the commissioner in the custody of  the  commissioner  of taxation and finance and shall be subject to execution to satisfy any  judgment  for  damages  for  bodily  injury  or  death,  or injury to or  destruction of property, arising out of the ownership, maintenance,  use  or  operation of the motor vehicle with respect to which the deposit has  been accepted, and subject to the same limits  on  amounts  required  by  this  article  for an owner's policy of liability insurance, and if such  moneys or securities shall be otherwise subjected to attachment  or  any  execution,  the  depositor  shall  immediately  furnish  such additional  moneys or securities, not otherwise subject to attachment or  execution,  to meet the requirements of this article.    2.  The  commissioner  shall not accept such moneys or securities as a  financial security deposit unless accompanied by evidence that there are  no unsatisfied judgments against such person registered in the office of  the county clerk of the county where such person resides."
VAT315,"Vehicle and Traffic      315. Release  of  financial  security  bonds  or  deposits.  1.  The  commissioner, upon the surrender of the registration and  number  plates  for  a  motor vehicle for which a financial security bond or deposit was  accepted by the commissioner, shall permit the cancellation of any  such  bond  or  shall  direct  that  any  such  deposit  be  returned  by  the  commissioner of taxation and finance. The commissioner shall not release  such bond or deposit  in  the  event  any  action  for  damages  upon  a  liability  referred  to  in this article is then pending or any judgment  upon any such liability then outstanding  and  unsatisfied,  or  in  the  event  the  commissioner has received notice that such person has within  the period of three months immediately  preceding  been  involved  as  a  driver  in  any motor vehicle accident. An affidavit of the applicant of  non-existence of such facts shall be sufficient evidence thereof in  the  absence of evidence to the contrary in the records of the bureau.    2.  The commissioner, subject to such reasonable regulations as he may  establish  shall  permit  the  form  of  proof  of  financial   security  acceptable  under  this  article  to  be substituted for another form of  proof of financial security which may already have been accepted by  the  commissioner as complying with the provisions of this article."
VAT316,"Vehicle and Traffic      316. Self-insurers.  The  commissioner,  in his discretion, may upon  the application of a person having registered in his name in this  state  more   than   twenty-five   motor   vehicles,  issue  a  certificate  of  self-insurance when he is  reasonably  satisfied  that  such  person  is  possessed  and  will  continue  to  be possessed of financial ability to  respond to judgments obtained against such person, arising  out  of  the  ownership,  maintenance,  use  or  operation  of any such person's motor  vehicles. Upon due notice and hearing,  the  commissioner  may,  in  his  discretion   and  upon  reasonable  grounds,  cancel  a  certificate  of  self-insurance.    As a condition to the issuance of a certificate of self-insurance, the  registrant shall pay annually in addition to any other fee prescribed by  this chapter, a fee of one dollar and fifty cents for each motor vehicle  registered in his name and the aggregate amount of such  fees  shall  be  applied  in reduction of the assessment levied pursuant to section three  hundred seventeen.    As  a  further  condition  to  the  issuance  of  a   certificate   of  self-insurance,  the  registrant  shall  pay annually in addition to any  other fee prescribed by this  chapter,  an  amount  per  vehicle  to  be  determined  by  the  Motor  Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation  pursuant to section five thousand two hundred seven of the insurance law  for each motor vehicle registered in his name and the  aggregate  amount  of  such  fees  shall  be  transmitted  by the commissioner to the Motor  Vehicle  Accident  Indemnification  Corporation  continued  pursuant  to  section  five  thousand  two  hundred  three  of the insurance law to be  applied in reduction of assessments levied by said corporation  pursuant  to section five thousand two hundred seven of the insurance law.    Notwithstanding  the provisions of any other section, for the purposes  of this section, the term ""motor vehicle"" shall include ""snowmobiles"" as  defined by subdivision six of  8-0105 of the conservation law."

The  total amount of  expenses incurred in connection with the administration of this  article  shall  be  paid  by  all  insurance  carriers  which  issue  policies or  contracts of automobile bodily injury insurance risks  subject  to  this  article  resident  or  located  in  this  state  in  accordance with the  provisions of this section.    2. Estimate of expenses. (a) The commissioner  annually,  as  soon  as  practicable,  shall estimate the total amount of expenses which shall be  incurred during the  succeeding  fiscal  year  in  connection  with  the  administration of this article. Such expenses, in addition to the direct  costs  of  personal  service,  shall include the cost of maintenance and  operation, the  cost  of  retirement  contributions  made  and  workers'  compensation  premiums paid by the state for or on account of personnel,  rentals for space occupied in state-owned or state-leased buildings, the  amounts paid to a city, county, town, village or the division  of  state  police for the enforcement of orders issued pursuant to this article and  all other direct or indirect costs.    (b)  The  commissioner  shall  on  or before February first assess the  total amount of such expenses,  as  so  estimated,  pro  rata  upon  all  insurance  carriers  subject  to  the  provisions  of  this  section  in  proportion to the premiums reported by such carriers to  the  department  of  financial  services  for  policies or contracts of automobile bodily  injury insurance on risks subject to this article resident or located in  this state for the year prior to the previous calendar year.    (c) For fiscal years beginning on  and  after  April  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-three,  each  such  insurance carrier shall make partial  payments of the assessment levied against it as follows, one-quarter  of  the total on March tenth of the preceding fiscal year and one-quarter on  June  tenth, one-quarter on September tenth, and the balance on December  tenth of the fiscal year, or on such other dates as the budget  director  may  prescribe.  Provided,  however,  that  the payment due March tenth,  nineteen hundred eighty-three for the fiscal year beginning April first,  nineteen hundred eighty-three shall not be required  to  be  paid  until  June  tenth, nineteen hundred eighty-three.

Final assessment. (a) The commissioner and the department of  audit  and  control  annually,  as soon as practicable after April first, shall  ascertain the total amount of expenses  incurred  during  the  preceding  fiscal  year  in  connection with the administration of this article. An  itemized statement of the expenses  so  ascertained  shall  be  open  to  public  inspection  in  the  office  of the commissioner for thirty days  after notice to those liable to be assessed for such expenses.    (b) As soon as practicable after January first, each insurance carrier  subject  to  the  provisions  of  this  section  shall  file  with   the  commissioner a report of the total amount of gross direct premiums, less  return  premiums thereon received during the preceding calendar year for  policies or contracts of automobile bodily  injury  insurance  on  risks  subject to this article resident or located in this state.    (c)  The  commissioner shall then determine the amount of expenses due  from each insurance carrier subject to the provisions  of  this  section  based  upon  the  final  determination  of  total expenses and the final  amount of premiums filed by the insurance carriers and shall notify each  such insurance carrier of such assessment. Within thirty days of receipt  of such notification each such carrier shall pay  the  total  amount  of  such  assessment less the total amount paid as a result of the estimated  assessments. If the total amount of the final assessment  is  less  than  the  amount  already paid, such excess payment shall be refunded to such  insurance  carrier  or  at  the  option  of  the  assessed  applied   to  assessments  for  the  succeeding  fiscal  year  as  requested  by  such  insurance carriers.    (d)  To  fully  fund  such  pilot database system and bar code program  established pursuant  to  subdivision  four  of  section  three  hundred  thirteen  of  this article, the commissioner shall utilize the following  three sources of revenue: (1) twenty-five percent of all civil penalties  imposed upon persons fined pursuant  to  paragraph  (b)  of  subdivision  one-a  of  section  three  hundred  eighteen of this article, (2) monies  obtained from grants that may be awarded to the  commissioner  from  the  motor  vehicle  theft  and  insurance fraud prevention fund, and (3) pro  rata assessments upon all insurance carriers subject to  the  provisions  of  this  section  in  proportion to the premium estimates filed by such  carriers.    4. The commissioner shall levy and collect such  assessments  and  pay  the  same  into the state treasury, subject to the provisions of section  one hundred twenty-one of the state finance law."
VAT318,"Vehicle and Traffic      318. Revocation of registrations, drivers' licenses and non-resident  privileges. 1. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the  commissioner,  upon receipt of evidence that proof of financial security  for any motor vehicle, other  than  a  motorcycle  or  a  motor  vehicle  registered  with  registration  plates  of this state issued in the year  corresponding  to  the  model  year  date  in  which  the  vehicle   was  manufactured pursuant to schedule G of subdivision seven of section four  hundred  one  of  this chapter, registered in this state is no longer in  effect shall suspend the registration of such vehicle and  the  driver's  license  of  the  registrant,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  subdivision one-a of this section.    (b) Such motor vehicle shall not be registered or reregistered in  the  name  of  such  person,  or in any other name where the commissioner has  reasonable grounds to believe that such registration  or  reregistration  will  have  the effect of defeating the purposes of this article, and no  other motor vehicle shall be registered  in  the  name  of  such  person  during the period of such suspension.    (c) Suspension shall not be made under this subdivision upon the basis  of  a  lapse or termination of insurance if the registration certificate  and number plates of the motor vehicle are surrendered prior to the time  at which the termination of insurance becomes effective. Such  surrender  shall  be  made  to  such officers of the department as the commissioner  shall direct, but  the  registrant  at  his  option  may  surrender  the  registration  and  number plates to any county clerk who is acting as an  agent of the commissioner pursuant to section two hundred five  of  this  chapter.  Such  county  clerk may accept a surrender of registration and  number plates and require the payment of a fee  of  one  dollar  whether  such surrender is made before or after the effective date of termination  of  insurance. The county clerk shall retain any such fee which may have  been collected, and shall  return  such  registration  certificates  and  number  plates,  or  dispose  of  the  same,  only  as prescribed by the  commissioner. For the purposes of  this  section  the  expiration  of  a  registration  without renewal of such registration shall be deemed to be  a surrender of registration as of the date of expiration.    (d) Suspension shall not be made under this subdivision upon the basis  of a lapse or termination of insurance if the vehicle has been, or  will  be,  prior  to  the  date of such lapse or termination, removed from the  United States in North America  and  the  Dominion  of  Canada  for  the  purpose  of  international  traffic,  provided  that  the  owner of such  vehicle, prior to the date of such lapse or termination, has filed  with  the  commissioner  a  statement, in a form prescribed by him, indicating  that the vehicle has been, or will  be,  so  removed,  and  agreeing  to  notify  the  commissioner  immediately upon return of the vehicle to the  United States in North America or the Dominion of Canada.  Upon  receipt  of  the  foregoing  statement the commissioner shall restrict the use of  the registration to  such  international  traffic  until  new  proof  of  financial security has been secured for the vehicle.    (e)  Suspension need not be made under this subdivision upon the basis  of a lapse or termination of insurance if  the  period  of  time  during  which  the  motor vehicle remained both registered and uninsured was not  more than seven days.  The  commissioner  shall  promulgate  regulations  governing  the  conditions under which suspension action may be withheld  pursuant to this paragraph.    1-a. (a) The suspension of a registration provided in subdivision  one  of  this section shall take effect on the date specified in the order of  suspension and shall remain in effect until the registration certificate  and number plates of the motor vehicle  have  been  surrendered  to  the  commissioner  and thereafter for a period of time equal to the time from  the date of termination of  financial  security  to  the  date  of  such  surrender  or  to  the date upon which subsequent financial security was  obtained or to the date  on  which  the  registrant  no  longer  had  an  insurable interest in the vehicle.    (b)   Notwithstanding   the   provisions  of  paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision, an order of suspension issued pursuant to paragraph (a)  or  (e)  of this subdivision may be terminated if the registrant pays to the  commissioner a civil penalty in the amount of eight dollars for each day  up to thirty days for which financial security was not in  effect,  plus  ten  dollars  for each day from the thirty-first to the sixtieth day for  which financial security was not in effect, plus twelve dollars for each  day from the sixty-first  to  the  ninetieth  day  for  which  financial  security  was  not  in effect. Of each eight dollar penalty, six dollars  will  be  deposited  in  the  general  fund  and  two  dollars  in   the  miscellaneous  special  revenue  fund - compulsory insurance account. Of  each ten dollar penalty collected, six dollars will be deposited in  the  general fund, two dollars will be deposited in the miscellaneous special  revenue  fund  -  compulsory insurance account, and two dollars shall be  deposited in the dedicated highway and  bridge  trust  fund  established  pursuant  to  section  eighty-nine-b  of  the  state finance law and the  dedicated mass  transportation  fund  established  pursuant  to  section  eighty-nine-c  of the state finance law and distributed according to the  provisions of subdivision (d) of section three hundred one-j of the  tax  law.  Of  each  twelve  dollar  penalty  collected,  six dollars will be  deposited into the general fund, two dollars will be deposited into  the  miscellaneous  special  revenue fund - compulsory insurance account, and  four dollars shall be deposited in  the  dedicated  highway  and  bridge  trust  fund  established  pursuant to section eighty-nine-b of the state  finance law and  the  dedicated  mass  transportation  fund  established  pursuant   to  section  eighty-nine-c  of  the  state  finance  law  and  distributed according to the provisions of subdivision  (d)  of  section  three  hundred one-j of the tax law. The foregoing provision shall apply  only once during any thirty-six month period and only if the  registrant  surrendered  the  certificate  of  registration and number plates to the  commissioner not more than ninety days from the date of  termination  of  financial security or submits to the commissioner new proof of financial  security   which  took  effect  not  more  than  ninety  days  from  the  termination of financial security.    (c) No number plates shall be returned to the registrant  until  proof  of financial security is submitted to the commissioner.    (d)  The  provisions  of  this  subdivision relating to termination of  suspension upon payment of a civil penalty  shall  be  applicable  to  a  registrant only one time during any three year period.    (e)   If   a   registrant  has  not  surrendered  his  certificate  of  registration and number plates or  obtained  financial  security  within  ninety  days  from  the  date  of termination of financial security, the  commissioner shall suspend the driver's license of any such  registrant.  Such  suspension  shall  take effect on the date specified in such order  and shall remain in effect from the date of surrender  of  such  license  and  thereafter  for  the  period  of  time  of  the  suspension  of the  registrant's registration.    (g)  Any  civil  penalty  paid  pursuant  to  paragraph  (b)  of  this  subdivision  shall  be  separate  and  distinct  from  any civil penalty  assessed pursuant to subdivision five of section three hundred  nineteen  of this chapter.    2.  (a)  The commissioner upon receipt of evidence that the owner of a  motor vehicle  registered  in  this  state,  or  an  unregistered  motor  vehicle,  has  operated,  or permitted such motor vehicle to be operated  upon the public highways of this or  any  other  state  while  proof  of  financial security was not in effect with respect to such vehicle, shall  revoke  the  registration,  if  any,  of  the  vehicle  and the driver's  license, if any, of such owner.    (b)  Such  motor  vehicle  shall not be registered in the name of such  person, or in any other  name  where  the  commissioner  has  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  such  registration  will  have the effect of  defeating the purpose of this article, and no other motor vehicle  shall  be  registered  in  the  name  of  such person, nor any driver's license  issued to such person, for a period of one year from the  date  of  such  revocation.    3. (a) The commissioner, upon receipt of evidence that a person, other  than  the  owner,  has operated upon the public highways of this state a  motor vehicle  registered  in  this  state,  or  an  unregistered  motor  vehicle,  with  knowledge  that  proof  of financial security was not in  effect with respect to such vehicle, shall revoke the  driver's  license  of  such  person,  or  if he is a non-resident, the non-resident driving  privileges of such person.    (b) No new driver's license shall be issued, or  non-resident  driving  privilege restored to such person for a period of one year from the date  of such revocation.    (c)  This subdivision shall not apply to any person who at the time of  operation of such motor vehicle had in effect an  operator's  policy  of  liability  insurance,  as  hereinafter  defined,  with  respect  to  his  operation of such vehicle or to a police officer or member of the  state  police  who  is compelled to assume the custody and operation of a motor  vehicle of another because such motor vehicle was  (1)  stolen  from  or  lost  by  the  owner,  (2)  abandoned,  either by the owner or any other  person with or without the owner's consent, (3) is being operated  by  a  person  disabled  so as not to be able to operate it properly, or (4) is  being operated by an intoxicated person.    4. (a) The commissioner, upon receipt of evidence that the owner of  a  motor  vehicle  not  registered  in this state has operated or permitted  such motor vehicle to be operated upon the public highways of this state  while proof of financial security was not in effect with respect to such  vehicle, shall revoke such  person's  privilege  to  operate  any  motor  vehicle  in  this  state  and the privilege of the operation within this  state of any motor vehicle owned by him.    (b) Such non-resident privileges shall not be restored for a period of  one year from the date of such revocation.    5. (a) The commissioner, upon receipt of evidence that a person, other  than the owner of the vehicle, has operated upon the public highways  of  this  state a motor vehicle not registered in this state, with knowledge  that proof of financial security was not in effect with respect to  such  vehicle  shall revoke the driver's license of such person, or if he is a  non-resident, the non-resident privileges of such person.    (b) No new driver's license shall be issued, or non-resident privilege  restored to such person for a period of one year from the date  of  such  revocation.    (c)  This subdivision shall not apply to any person who at the time of  operation of such motor vehicle had in effect an  operator's  policy  of  liability  insurance,  as  hereinafter  defined,  with  respect  to  his  operation of such motor vehicle or to a police officer or member of  the  state  police  who is compelled to assume the custody and operation of a  motor vehicle of another because such motor vehicle was (1) stolen  from  or  lost  by  the owner, (2) abandoned, either by the owner or any other  person with or without the owner's consent, (3) is being operated  by  a  person  disabled  so as not to be able to operate it properly, or (4) is  being operated by an intoxicated person.    6.  Notice  of revocation pursuant to this section may be given to the  owner of a vehicle registered in this state or to a driver  licensed  in  this state, by mailing the same to such owner or licensee at the address  contained  in  the  certificate of registration for the vehicle owned by  such person or to the address contained on his or her driving license or  to the current address provided by the United States postal service.    7. Failure of such owner or  licensee  to  deliver  a  certificate  of  registration,  number  plates  or  driver's  license to the commissioner  after revocation thereof or  as  otherwise  provided  in  section  three  hundred twelve shall constitute a misdemeanor.    8.  An  operator's  policy  of  liability  insurance,  as used in this  section, shall mean  a  policy  issued  by  an  insurance  carrier  duly  authorized  to  transact  business  in  the state which shall insure the  person named therein as insured, against loss from the liability imposed  upon him by law for damages, including damages  for  care  and  loss  of  services,  because of bodily injury to or death of any person and injury  to or destruction of property arising out of the use by him of any motor  vehicle not owned by him, subject to the  same  minimum  provisions  and  approval required by subdivision four of section three hundred eleven of  this  chapter, with respect to an owner's policy of liability insurance.  With respect to a non-resident, such policy may  also  be  issued  by  a  non-admitted insurance carrier provided the requirements of this article  with  respect to issuance of an owner's policy of liability insurance by  such carrier have been met.    9. (a) If a motor vehicle has been involved in an  accident,  and  its  registration or the driver's license of its operator, or both, have been  revoked  pursuant  to  this  section,  then neither such vehicle nor any  other motor vehicle shall be registered or reregistered in the  name  of  its  owner  or  of any other person legally responsible for its use, nor  shall any driver's license be issued to such owner, person  or  operator  until  one year has passed since the date of such revocation and, as the  case may be, the commissioner has received  the  payments  and  evidence  required by paragraph (c) below.    (b)  If a motor vehicle not registered in this state is involved in an  accident in this state and the privilege of its  operation  within  this  state  has  been  revoked,  then  neither  its owner, any person legally  responsible for its use nor its operator shall exercise the privilege of  the operation of such vehicle within this  state  or  the  privilege  of  operation  within  this  state  of any motor vehicle, until one year has  passed since the date of  revocation  and,  as  the  case  may  be,  the  commissioner  has  received the payments and evidence as required in (c)  below.    (c) The payments and evidence referred to in paragraphs  (a)  and  (b)  above shall be evidence, satisfactory to the commissioner,    (1)  That  no  cause  of  action based upon such accident against such  owner, person legally responsible or operator has been commenced  within  a  period of one year from the date of the accident or a release thereof  has been given to such owner, person or operator, or    (2) That no judgment arising out of such cause of action  for  amounts  within the limits stated in paragraph (a) of subdivision four of section  three  hundred  eleven  against  such  owner, person or operator remains  unsatisfied, except that such registration and licensing privileges  may  be  restored on compliance with the procedures permitting the payment of  a judgment in installments provided in section three hundred thirty-four  and    (3) That all civil penalties required to be  paid  to  the  department  pursuant  to the provisions of subdivision five of section three hundred  nineteen of this chapter have been paid.    10. The provisions of subdivision seven of section five hundred ten of  this chapter shall apply to a revocation under this article.    11.  (a)  Where  the  license  or  privileges  of  any  person, or the  registration of a  motor  vehicle  registered  in  his  name,  has  been  suspended  or  revoked  under article six of this chapter, and the motor  vehicle accident indemnification corporation or an insurer has paid  any  amount  towards  satisfaction  of a judgment against such person, or has  obtained a judgment against such person as a result of payments made  to  third   parties  such  license,  privileges  or  registration  shall  be  suspended, or the suspension or revocation thereof shall  be  continued,  as provided in this subdivision.    (b)  If the license, privileges or registration of such person has not  been restored, the suspension or revocation thereof shall  be  continued  pending  the  satisfaction  of the requirements of paragraph (d) of this  subdivision.    (c) If the license, privileges or registration of such person has been  restored, the commissioner shall suspend such license or privilege,  and  may   suspend   such  registration,  pending  the  satisfaction  of  the  requirements of paragraph (d) of this subdivision.    (d) Such suspensions and revocations shall  be  continued  until  such  person  has  repaid  to the corporation or to such insurer any amount so  paid by it together with interest thereon at six per  centum  per  annum  from  the  date  of  such  payment,  unless  such  person submits to the  procedure provided for the payment of judgments  in  installments  under  section three hundred thirty-four of this chapter.    (e)  A  discharge  in  bankruptcy  shall  not  relieve a person of the  penalties and disabilities provided in this article.    12. (a) If the owner or operator of a  motor  vehicle  in  any  manner  involved  in  an  accident occurring in this state resulting in death or  bodily injuries to any person fails to produce satisfactory evidence  as  proof of financial security within forty-eight hours after the accident,  the motor vehicle shall be subject to impoundment and any peace officer,  acting  pursuant  to  his  special  duties,  or  any  police  officer is  authorized to impound and  store  such  motor  vehicle.  If  said  motor  vehicle  is subject to impoundment and is not so impounded, the owner or  his representative shall cause said motor vehicle  to  be  stored  in  a  public garage or storage place in this state as selected by the owner or  representative  and  shall  continue such storage for the period of time  provided in this section. The aforementioned  storage  shall  constitute  ""impoundment"" within the meaning of this section. The cost of storage of  any such impounded motor vehicle shall be borne by the owner. So long as  the impoundment is in force no person shall remove the impounded vehicle  or permit it to be removed from its place of impoundment except upon the  order of the commissioner.    (b)  Immediately  upon  impoundment,  the  owner or his representative  shall:    1. Notify the bailee of the impounded motor vehicle of the  fact  that  the same is stored as an impounded vehicle,    2.  Notify  the commissioner in writing of the street address and city  or municipality where said motor vehicle is stored, and    3. If the owner is a resident of this state, return  the  registration  certificate  and  registration plates with respect to such motor vehicle  to the commissioner.    If the owner or his representative fails to store said  motor  vehicle  as  required  by  subdivision  (a) and fails to return such registration  certificate and registration plates, the commissioner is  authorized  to  direct  any  peace  officer  acting  pursuant  to his special duties, or  police officer to impound and store said motor vehicle at the expense of  the  owner  and  to  take possession of the registration certificate and  registration plates and return the same to  the  commissioner  of  motor  vehicles.    (c)  The  impoundment  shall  continue  until  (1)  there  is  a final  disposition of the claim for death  or  bodily  injury  of  the  person,  resulting from the accident in which said motor vehicle was involved, by  payment of a judgment or settlement by the owner, or by a final judgment  in his favor, or (2) one year has elapsed since the date of the accident  and  no  filing  has  been  made  pursuant  to section five thousand two  hundred eight of the insurance law,  or  (3)  a  release  of  the  motor  vehicle  upon  order of the commissioner. The commissioner may order the  release of said motor vehicle upon the depositing with the  commissioner  of taxation and finance of security or a bond in such form and amount as  may  be  approved  by  the  commissioner.  If  said motor vehicle is not  released from impoundment after the lapse of one year, the  commissioner  may dispose of it by public sale and remit the proceeds from the sale to  the  commissioner  of  taxation and finance to be held pending the final  disposition of the claim.    (d) If repairs to an impounded motor vehicle are desired by the owner,  he, with the permission of the commissioner,  may  authorize  the  motor  vehicle  to  be taken to such repair shop or garage as he may select for  the  purpose  of  having  it  repaired  at  the  owner's  expense.  Upon  completion  of  such  repairs,  the  motor vehicle shall be impounded as  provided in subdivision (a).    Where the commissioner is satisfied  by  such  evidence  as  he  deems  sufficient,  that  any  motor  vehicle  is  so damaged that it cannot be  restored to operable condition, he may, in  his  discretion,  upon  such  conditions  as  he  deems  proper,  consent to the release of said motor  vehicle from impoundment.    (e) No owner of a motor vehicle subject to impoundment hereunder shall  transfer title to said motor vehicle nor his interest therein unless  he  furnishes   to  the  commissioner  security,  in  an  amount  which  the  commissioner is satisfied is equivalent to the value of said vehicle  or  his interest therein.    (f)  Nothing  herein  contained shall affect the rights or remedies of  any person holding a prior valid lien on an impounded vehicle, including  the right to take possession, existing at the  effective  date  of  this  section  or  the  right  of  the  bailee  to  a  lien for storage of the  impounded vehicle; provided, that such person shall, after the  sale  of  such  vehicle  for  the  satisfaction of any liens thereon, remit to the  commissioner as deposits of security under this article on behalf of the  former owner or purchaser of such vehicle any sums which such  owner  or  purchaser would otherwise be entitled to receive.    (g)  Any  person  who  wilfully violates any of the provisions of this  subdivision shall, in addition to any other penalty provided by law,  be  liable  to  the people of this state for a penalty in an amount not less  than one hundred dollars nor more than one  thousand  dollars  for  each  violation.    13.  (a)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b), no revocation or  suspension order shall be issued pursuant to this section,  or  if  such  revocation  or suspension order has been issued, it shall be terminated,  if the commissioner shall determine that the  person  involved  was  not  aware  of  the  fact  that  financial security was not in effect and the  failure to have such financial security in effect was caused  solely  by  the negligence or malfeasance of a person other than such person.    (b)  The  burden  of proving lack of knowledge that financial security  was not in effect  and  that  such  failure  resulted  solely  from  the  negligence or malfeasance of another shall be upon the person seeking to  avoid  revocation  or suspension action. Such facts shall be established  by clear and convincing evidence, either by the submission of affidavits  or at a hearing called in the discretion of the commissioner.    14. No registration and/or license, which has been revoked pursuant to  this  section  because  the  holder  was  convicted  of  driving without  insurance in violation of  subdivision  one  of  section  three  hundred  nineteen  of  this chapter, shall be restored until all civil penalties,  required to be paid to the department  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  subdivision five of section three hundred nineteen of this chapter, have  been paid.    15.  Notwithstanding  any provisions of this section, a restricted use  license or privilege of operating a motor vehicle in this state  may  be  issued  to a person who has had his license or such privilege revoked or  suspended pursuant to any provision of this section in  accordance  with  article twenty-one-A of this chapter."
VAT319,"Vehicle and Traffic      319. Penalties.  1.  Any owner of a motor vehicle registered in this  state, or an unregistered motor vehicle, who shall  operate  such  motor  vehicle or permit it to be operated in this state without having in full  force  and  effect  the financial security required by the provisions of  this chapter and any other person who shall operate in  this  state  any  motor  vehicle  registered  in  this  state,  or  an  unregistered motor  vehicle, with the knowledge that the owner thereof does not have in full  force and effect such proof of financial security, except a person  who,  at  the  time  of  operation  of  such  motor  vehicle, had in effect an  operator's policy of liability insurance, as defined  in  section  three  hundred eighteen, with respect to his operation of such vehicle shall be  guilty of a traffic infraction and upon conviction may be fined not less  than  one  hundred  fifty dollars or more than one thousand five hundred  dollars or may be imprisoned for not more than fifteen days or both.  In  addition   to   the  penalties  herein  set  forth,  such  person,  upon  conviction, shall also become liable for payment to  the  department  of  the civil penalty provided in subdivision five of this section.    2. When the production of an insurance identification card is required  by  any  provision of this chapter, no person shall produce an insurance  identification card which indicates insurance coverage which is  not  in  effect.  In  any  prosecution or proceeding alleging a violation of this  subdivision, it shall be an  affirmative  defense  that  the  person  so  charged did not have knowledge that the insurance indicated on such card  was  not  in  effect.  A  violation  of  this  subdivision  shall  be  a  misdemeanor.    3. Every person who operates a vehicle registered in this state, or  a  vehicle required to be registered in this state, shall, when required by  the commissioner's regulations, produce an insurance identification card  when  requested  by  any  peace  officer, acting pursuant to his special  duties, police officer or magistrate. The failure to so produce  such  a  card  shall  be  presumptive evidence that such person was operating the  vehicle without having in effect  financial  security  required  by  the  provisions of this chapter.    4. Where the commissioner finds, other than by means of the receipt of  a certificate of conviction, that a person has violated any provision of  subdivision  one  of  this  section, such person shall become liable for  payment to the department of the civil penalty provided  in  subdivision  five  of  this  section. However, the enforcement of such civil penalty,  and of any revocation order based upon such finding, shall be stayed  at  the request of the person against whom such civil penalty and revocation  order  has  been  issued until after a hearing, provided such person was  not both the operator and the owner of the motor vehicle which was being  operated without the required financial security being in effect.  After  such  hearing,  the  stay  of  enforcement  of  the  civil  penalty  and  revocation order shall be vacated unless it is found by a  preponderance  of the evidence that such person, (a) if he was the operator and not the  owner of the motor vehicle, had no knowledge that the financial security  required  for such motor vehicle was not in effect; or (b) if he was the  owner and not the operator of the motor vehicle, that he did not permit,  either expressly or impliedly, the operation of such motor vehicle.    5. The civil penalty for  a  violation  of  subdivision  one  of  this  section shall be seven hundred fifty dollars."

This section shall  not  apply:  (1)  to  such  owner  or  operator  (or  chauffeur) if such owner had in effect at the time of such accident with  respect to such motor vehicle a standard provisions automobile liability  policy  in form approved by the superintendent of financial services and  issued by an insurance company authorized to do business in  this  state  or,  if  such  motor  vehicle  was not registered in this state or was a  motor vehicle which was registered elsewhere than in this state  at  the  effective  date  of  the  policy, or the most recent renewal thereof, an  automobile  liability  policy  acceptable  to  the   superintendent   of  financial  services  as  substantially  the  equivalent of such standard  provisions  automobile  liability  policy;  (2)  to  such  operator  (or  chauffeur),  if  not  the  owner  of such motor vehicle, if there was in  effect at the time of such accident such a policy with  respect  to  his  operation  of  motor vehicles not owned by him or, if such motor vehicle  was a private passenger motor vehicle, with respect to his operation  of  private  passenger  motor vehicles not owned by him or (3) to such owner  or operator (or chauffeur) if the liability of such  owner  or  operator  (or  chauffeur)  for  damages  resulting  from  such accident is, in the  judgment of the commissioner, covered by any  other  form  of  liability  insurance  policy  issued  by  an  insurance  company  authorized  to do  business in this state or by a bond, provided every such policy or  bond  mentioned  herein  is  subject,  if  the accident has resulted in bodily  injury, to a limit, exclusive of  interest  and  costs,  of  twenty-five  thousand  dollars  or death to a limit, exclusive of interest and costs,  of fifty thousand dollars, because of bodily injury to or death  of  one  person in any one accident and, subject to said limit for one person, to  a  limit  of  fifty  thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or one  hundred thousand dollars because of death of two or more persons in  any  one  accident,  and,  if  the  accident  has  resulted  in  injury to or  destruction of property, to a limit of ten thousand dollars  because  of  injury  to  or  destruction of property of others in any one accident or  (4) to such owner or operator if the commissioner shall  determine  that  the  failure  to  have  liability coverage as described above was caused  solely by the negligence or malfeasance  of  a  person  other  than  the  person whose license or registration has been suspended or is subject to  suspension, and that the person seeking to avoid such suspension was not  aware  of  the lack of such liability coverage. However, with respect to  the provisions of (4) above, the burden  of  proof  shall  be  upon  the  person  seeking  to avoid such suspension action. Provided further, that  such facts shall be established by clear and convincing evidence, either  by the submission of affidavits or at a hearing called in the discretion  of the commissioner.    Upon  receipt  of  notice  of  such accident, the insurance carrier or  surety company which issued such policy or bond shall furnish for filing  with the commissioner a written notice that such policy or bond  was  in  effect  at the time of such accident or shall notify the commissioner in  such manner as he may require in case such policy or  bond  was  not  in  effect at the time of such accident.    In  case  any  such operator (or chauffeur) or owner has no license to  operate issued under this chapter or no motor vehicle registered in  his  name  in  this  state, he shall not be allowed a license or registration  until he has complied with this article to the same extent as  would  be  necessary  if  he  had  held  an operator's or chauffeur's license and a  motor vehicle registration issued under this chapter at the time of  the  accident.    (b)  Such  security,  where ordered, shall be in such form and in such  amount as the commissioner may require, but in no case in excess of  the  amount  of  proof  required  by  section three hundred forty-one of this  article. The commissioner may reduce the amount of security  ordered  in  any  case  within  six months after the date of the accident, if, in his  judgment, the  amount  ordered  is  too  large.  In  case  the  security  originally  ordered  has  been  deposited, the excess deposited over the  reduced amount ordered  shall  be  returned  to  the  depositor  or  his  personal  representative  forthwith,  notwithstanding  the provisions of  subdivision (c) of this section.    (c) Security furnished in compliance with  the  requirements  of  this  section  shall  be  placed  by  the  commissioner  in the custody of the  commissioner of taxation and finance and shall be applicable only to the  payment of a judgment against the depositor for damages arising  out  of  the  accident  in  question in an action at law begun not later than one  year after the  date  of  such  accident  or,  upon  assignment  of  the  depositor, made not later than one year after the date of such accident,  to  the  settlement  of  a  claim  arising out of such accident, or upon  assignment of the depositor, made after the expiration of one year after  the date of such accident, to the settlement of an action at  law  begun  not  later  than  one  year after the date of such accident. All of such  payments made out of the deposited security shall be  made  as  follows:  Payment  shall  first  be  made to each of the judgment creditors and to  each of the claimants who have agreed  to  settle  their  claims,  whose  damages  were  evaluated  by  the commissioner, in an amount not greater  than the amount fixed in  their  respective  evaluations.  Whenever  the  commissioner  shall  be  given  evidence,  satisfactory to him, that the  amounts of all claims for damages against the depositor arising  out  of  such  accident  are  fixed,  either by judgment or settlement agreement,  payment shall be made out of  any  balance  remaining  after  the  first  distribution  to  each  of  those  persons whose judgments or settlement  amounts have not been fully paid but whose damages were evaluated by the  commissioner,  in  proportion  to  the  amounts  of   their   respective  evaluations  unless there is sufficient to make payment in full; and any  balance remaining after the first and second distributions are completed  shall be paid to those judgment creditors and those claimants  who  have  agreed  to  settle their claims but whose damages were not evaluated, in  proportion to the amounts of their respective  judgments  or  settlement  amounts  unless  there  is  sufficient  to  make  payment  in full. Such  deposit, or any balance thereof, shall be returned to the  depositor  or  his  personal representative whenever after the expiration of such year,  the commissioner shall be given  evidence,  satisfactory  to  him,  that  there  is  no  such  action  pending and no such judgment unsatisfied or  whenever, before the expiration of such year, the commissioner shall  be  given  evidence,  satisfactory  to  him,  that there is no such judgment  unsatisfied and that there is no existing cause of  action  against  the  depositor for damages arising out of such accident.    (c-1) After security, furnished in compliance with the requirements of  this  section,  has remained on deposit for five years, the commissioner  shall make a determination as to whether the  deposit,  or  any  balance  thereof,  is returnable to the depositor or the person entitled thereto.  In the event that such deposit, or any balance thereof, is determined to  be returnable, but remains unclaimed by  the  depositor  or  the  person  entitled  thereto  for  a  period of one year following the date of such  determination, such unclaimed deposit, or any balance thereof, shall  be  deemed  abandoned  property  subject  to the provisions of the abandoned  property law.    (d) The provisions of subdivision (a) of this section shall not  apply  to  the  owner  of  a  motor  vehicle  operated  by  one having obtained  possession or control thereof without the expressed or  implied  consent  of  such owner, to a police officer or member of the state police who is  compelled to assume the custody and operation  of  a  motor  vehicle  of  another  because  such  motor vehicle was (1) stolen from or lost by the  owner, (2) abandoned, either by the owner or any other  person  with  or  without  the owner's consent, (3) is being operated by a person disabled  so as not to be able to operate it properly, or (4) is being operated by  an intoxicated person; or to either the owner or  operator  of  a  motor  vehicle  involved  in an accident wherein no damage or injury was caused  to other than the person or property of such owner or operator.    (e) In lieu of deposit of  security  when  required  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  section  the  commissioner  may  accept  a written  agreement, executed and acknowledged by the person required  to  deposit  security  and  any  person  who  has  sustained bodily injury, including  death, or damage to his property, or his legal representative, providing  for the payment of an agreed amount in installments, with respect to the  claims of such  person  for  injuries  or  damages  resulting  from  the  accident.  In  the  event of default in payment of any installment under  such agreement, then upon notice of such default the commissioner  shall  forthwith   suspend   the  license  and  registration  certificates  and  registration plates of the person in  default  until  release  has  been  filed with the commissioner indicating that the entire agreed amount has  been  paid. But in no case shall such agreement be used in lieu of proof  of maintenance  of  financial  responsibility  in  the  future  required  pursuant to the provisions of this section."
VAT336,"Vehicle and Traffic      336. Duty  of courts to report judgments. The clerk of the court, or  the court where it has no clerk, shall,  upon  written  request  of  the  judgment  creditor  or  his  attorney,  forward  to  the  commissioner a  certified copy of transcript of any judgment for damages, the  rendering  and  non-payment  of which judgment requires the commissioner to suspend  the operator's or chauffeur's license and/or the  registrations  in  the  name  of  the  judgment  debtor hereunder, such copy or transcript to be  forwarded to the commissioner immediately upon the expiration of fifteen  days after such judgment has become final by expiration  without  appeal  of  the  time  within which appeal might have been perfected or by final  affirmance on appeal, and has not been otherwise stayed, or satisfied."

(a) The suspension required in sections  three hundred thirty-two, three hundred thirty-four  and  three  hundred  thirty-five  (e) shall remain in effect, the motor vehicle in any manner  involved in such accident shall not be registered in  the  name  of  the  person  whose  license and/or registration certificate was so suspended,  or in any other name where the commissioner has  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  that  such  registration  will have the effect of defeating the  purposes of this article, and no other motor vehicle shall be registered  in the name of such person nor any new licenses issued  to  such  person  unless  and  until such judgment is satisfied or stayed or is discharged  in  bankruptcy  and  the  judgment  debtor  gives  proof  of   financial  responsibility  in  the  future  as  required  pursuant to section three  hundred thirty-five except under the conditions as  stated  in  sections  three hundred thirty-three and three hundred thirty-four.    (b) The suspension required in section three hundred thirty-five shall  remain  in  effect,  the  motor  vehicle  in any manner involved in such  accident shall not be registered in the name of the person whose license  and/or registration certificate was so suspended, or in any  other  name  where  the  commissioner  has  reasonable  grounds  to believe that such  registration will have the effect of  defeating  the  purposes  of  this  article,  and  no other motor vehicle shall be registered in the name of  such person nor any new licenses issued to such person, unless and until  such person complies with the requirement  with  respect  to  furnishing  security,  or  unless and until such person has obtained a release, or a  favorable judgment in an action at law to recover damages resulting from  such accident or unless such person shall have satisfied in  the  manner  herein  provided  any  judgment  rendered against such person in such an  action,  or  unless  such  judgment  rendered  against  such  person  is  discharged  in bankruptcy, and at all events until such person gives and  thereafter maintains proof of his financial responsibility.    Provided, however, that  any  person  whose  license  or  registration  became   subject  to  suspension  or  has  been  suspended  pursuant  to  subdivision (a) of section three hundred  thirty-five,  whether  or  not  such   person   has   furnished   security   and   proof   of  financial  responsibility, shall be relieved from furnishing or  maintaining  proof  of  financial  responsibility if (1) one year has elapsed since the date  of the accident,  (2)  nine  months  have  elapsed  since  the  date  of  compliance with any suspension order made against such person because of  such accident, (3) such person has neither paid nor agreed in writing to  pay  anything  for damages resulting from such accident, (4) no suit for  damages because thereof has been brought against  such  person  and  (5)  such  person  is  not required to furnish or maintain proof of financial  responsibility for some reason other than for having  been  involved  in  such  accident.  If  a  suit  or  suits  for damages resulting from such  accident shall have been brought and  such  suit  or  suits  shall  have  resulted  in a judgment or judgments, the successful person in such suit  or suits shall be relieved  from  furnishing  or  maintaining  proof  of  financial  responsibility forthwith provided such person is not required  to furnish or maintain such proof for reasons other than for having been  involved in such  accident  and,  in  case  such  person  has  furnished  security  because  of having been involved in such accident, it shall be  returned to such person or the personal representative  of  such  person  forthwith  notwithstanding  the provisions of subdivision (c) of section  three hundred thirty-five. The fact of  having  been  involved  in  such  accident  shall  not  bar  the issuance of license and registration to a  person who has been relieved from furnishing  or  maintaining  proof  of  financial responsibility pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph.    (c)  A  discharge  in  bankruptcy  following the rendering of any such  judgment  shall  not  relieve  the  judgment  debtor  from  any  of  the  requirements  of  this article unless otherwise provided in subdivisions  (a) and (b) of this section."
VAT338,"Vehicle and Traffic      338. Application  to  non-resident,  other persons. (a) Whenever, by  the laws of this state, the commissioner has the  power  to  suspend  or  revoke  a  license  if  the  operator  or chauffeur were a resident, the  commissioner shall have similar power to suspend or revoke  the  license  or  to  forbid  the  operation of a motor vehicle in this state owned by  such  operator  or  chauffeur  if  the  operator  or  chauffeur   is   a  non-resident.  And  whenever  by the laws of this state the commissioner  has the power to suspend or revoke  the  registration  certificates  and  registration plates if the owner were a resident, the commissioner shall  have  similar  power  to  forbid  the operation within this state of any  motor vehicle if the owner is a non-resident.    (b) All of the provisions of this article shall apply  to  any  person  who is not a resident of this state under the same circumstances as they  would apply to a resident; and, in such event, such a non-resident shall  not  operate any motor vehicle in this state nor shall any motor vehicle  owned  by  him  be  operated  in  this  state,  unless  and  until  such  non-resident  or  the owner of the motor vehicle, if another person, has  complied  with  the  requirements  of  this  article  with  respect   to  furnishing  security and giving proof of financial responsibility in the  future.    (c) Upon conviction of a non-resident or in case  of  any  unsatisfied  judgment rendered against a non-resident which conviction or unsatisfied  judgment results in suspension of such non-resident's driving privileges  in  this state and/or the prohibition of the operation within this state  of any motor vehicle owned by such non-resident, the commissioner  shall  transmit  a  certified  copy of any record of any such conviction or any  such unsatisfied judgment or any other action pursuant to  this  article  resulting  in  suspension of a non-resident's driving privileges in this  state and/or the prohibition of the operation within this state  of  any  motor   vehicle   owned  by  such  non-resident  to  the  motor  vehicle  commissioner or officer performing the functions of  a  commissioner  in  the state in which such non-resident resides.

Nor  is  any  such  policy required to insure any liability on account of (1)  damage to property of others in charge of the insured or of  his  agents  or employees (2) bodily injury to or death of the insured, or (3) except  as provided in paragraphs one and two of subsection (g) of section three  thousand  four  hundred twenty of the insurance law, bodily injury to or  death of the spouse of the insured, or for injury  to  property  of  the  spouse  of the insured; and any insurance of any such liability afforded  by such a policy shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (f) of  this section.

(g) Several policies of one or more insurance carriers which  together  meet  the  requirements  of  this section shall be termed ""motor vehicle  liability policy"" within the meaning of this article.

The superintendent of  financial  services  shall  approve any form of policy which discloses the name and  address of the insured,  the  coverage  afforded  by  such  policy,  the  premium  charged therefor, the policy period, the limit of liability and  the agreement that the insurance thereunder is  provided  in  accordance  with  the  coverage  defined  in  this section and is subject to all the  provisions of this article.    (i) Every motor vehicle liability  policy  shall  be  subject  to  the  following provisions which need not be contained therein:    (1)  The  liability  of  any  company  under a motor vehicle liability  policy shall become absolute whenever loss or  damage  covered  by  said  policy  occurs,  and the satisfaction by the insured of a final judgment  for such loss or damage shall not be a condition precedent to the  right  or  duty  of  the  carrier  to  make  payment on account of such loss or  damage. No such policy shall be cancelled or annulled  as  respects  any  loss  or  damage  by  any  agreement between the carrier and the insured  after the said insured has become responsible for such loss  or  damage,  and  any  such cancellation or annullment shall be void. If the death of  the insured shall occur after the insured has become liable  during  the  policy period for loss or damage covered by the policy, the policy shall  not  be  deemed  terminated by such death with respect to such liability  and the company shall be liable thereunder in the same manner and to the  same extent as though death had not occurred. Upon  the  recovery  of  a  final  judgment  against  any person for any such loss or damage, if the  judgment debtor or the decedent whom he represents was at the accrual of  the cause of action insured against liability  therefor  under  a  motor  vehicle  liability  policy,  the  judgment creditor shall be entitled to  have the insurance money applied to the satisfaction  of  the  judgment.  But the policy may provide that the insured, or any other person covered  by  the policy, shall reimburse the company for payments made on account  of any accident,  claim  or  suit  involving  a  breach  of  the  terms,  provisions or conditions of the policy; and further, if the policy shall  provide  for  limits in excess of the limits designated in this section,  the insurance carrier may plead against  such  judgment  creditor,  with  respect  to  the amount of such excess limits of liability, any defenses  which it may be entitled to plead against the insured. Any  such  policy  may  further  provide for the prorating of the insurance thereunder with  other  applicable  valid  and  collectible  insurance.  If  the   death,  insolvency  or  bankruptcy  of the insured shall occur within the policy  period, the policy during the unexpired portion  of  such  period  shall  cover the legal representatives of the insured. No statement made by the  insured  or  on his behalf, and no violation of the terms of the policy,  shall operate to defeat or avoid the policy so as to bar recovery within  the limits provided in subdivision (b) of this section.    (2) The policy, the written application  therefor  (if  any)  and  any  rider  or  endorsement,  which shall not conflict with the provisions of  this article, shall constitute the entire contract between the parties.    (3) Any insurance carrier authorized to issue motor vehicle  liability  policies  as provided for in this article may, pending the issue of such  a policy, execute an agreement, to be known as a binder; or may, in lieu  of such a policy issue an indorsement to an  existing  policy;  each  of  which  shall  be  construed  to  provide indemnity or protection in like  manner and to the same extent as such a policy. The provisions  of  this  section shall apply to such binders and endorsements."

(e)  If  a  final  judgment rendered against the principal on the bond  filed with the commissioner as provided in this  article  shall  not  be  satisfied within fifteen days after its rendition, the judgment creditor  may,  for  his  own  use  and  benefit and at his sole expense, bring an  action on said bond in the name of the  state  against  the  company  or  persons executing such bond."

The  commissioner  shall  thereupon notify the owner of such motor vehicle or  motorcycle of the filing of such notice, and  unless  such  owner  shall  file  a  new bond or evidence of new bond or policy, as provided by this  section,  on  or  before  such  date  as  shall  be  specified  by   the  commissioner,  or  shall  place the number plates belonging to the motor  vehicle or motorcycle in the custody of the commissioner  or  his  agent  within such time, to remain in such custody until a new bond or evidence  of a new bond or policy is filed, the registration of such motor vehicle  or  motorcycle  shall be revoked as of the date specified in said notice  of the commissioner and no new registration shall be issued for a period  of thirty days. Forthwith after his registration  has  been  so  revoked  such owner shall return the number plates issued for such vehicle to the  commissioner.  The  provisions  of  subdivision  seven  of  section five  hundred ten of this chapter shall apply to such revocations.    Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this chapter, any such bond,  or policy of  insurance  shall  also  provide  for  uninsured  motorists  coverage  in  the  minimal  amount  and  in  the  form  provided  for in  subsection (f) of section three thousand  four  hundred  twenty  of  the  insurance law.    Nothing  in  this subdivision shall be construed to prevent compliance  therewith by filing a combination of bonds or policies or of a bond  and  policy  or  evidence  thereof  if  the  commissioner  approves  and  the  requirements of this subdivision are otherwise met.    (c) As a condition to filing evidence of a corporate surety bond,  the  registrant shall pay annually in addition to any other fee prescribed by  this chapter, a fee of one dollar and fifty cents for each motor vehicle  registered  in  his  name and the aggregate amount of such fees shall be  applied in the reduction of the assessment levied  pursuant  to  section  three hundred seventeen of this chapter.    (d)  As used in this section, a judgment or judgment for damages shall  include a final arbitration  award  and  any  unpaid  fees  due  to  the  arbitration  forum  established  pursuant  to  section five thousand one  hundred six of the insurance law.    1-a.  Every  person,  firm,  association  or  corporation  engaged  in  carrying  or  transporting  sick  or  injured  persons  in  any  hearse,  combination hearse or ambulance operated over, upon or  along  a  public  street  or  highway  within  a town having a population of less than two  thousand  inhabitants,  shall  secure  either a corporate surety bond or  policy of insurance executed by a surety or insurance company authorized  to do business in this state, containing like conditions to  secure  the  payment  of  damages  as  is  required to be provided for motor vehicles  operated for  the  transportation  of  passengers  for  hire;  provided,  however,  that  any  bond or policy of insurance so secured, may contain  the condition that it shall secure the payment of  damages  only  during  the time or times such hearse or combination hearse or ambulance is used  or  operated for the transportation of sick or injured persons and shall  not be operative or effective during any other time or times or for  the  payment  of damages incurred while being operated for any other purpose.  A bond or policy of insurance executed pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  subdivision  need  not  be  approved  or filed notwithstanding any  inconsistent provision of this section.    2. Any person, firm, association  or  corporation  operating  a  motor  vehicle  or  motorcycle  as  to  which  a bond or policy of insurance is  required by this section who or which shall  operate  such  vehicle,  or  cause  the same to be operated, while such a bond or policy, or evidence  thereof  as  required  by  this  section,  is  not  on  file  with   the  commissioner,  and  in  full  force  and  effect  shall  be  guilty of a  misdemeanor.    3. A person, firm, association or corporation engaged in the  business  of  renting  or  leasing  rental vehicles to be operated upon the public  highways for carrying passengers shall be subject to the  provisions  of  this  section  in  the  same  manner  and  to the same extent as if such  person, firm, association or corporation were actually  engaged  in  the  business of carrying or transporting passengers for hire.    Notwithstanding  the  provisions of subdivision one of this section, a  person, firm, association or corporation  engaged  in  the  business  of  renting  or leasing motor vehicles, having registered in this state more  than twenty-five motor  vehicles  subject  to  the  provisions  of  this  section   and   who  qualifies  as  hereinafter  provided,  may  file  a  certificate of self-insurance. The commissioner of motor vehicles in his  discretion may, upon the application of such a person, firm, association  or  corporation  issue  a  certificate  of  self-insurance  when  he  is  reasonably  satisfied that such person is possessed and will continue to  be possessed of financial  ability  to  respond  to  judgments  obtained  against  such  person, arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or  operation of any such  person's  motor  vehicle.  Upon  due  notice  and  hearing,  the  commissioner  may,  in his discretion and upon reasonable  grounds, cancel a certificate of self-insurance.    As a condition to the issuance  of  a  certificate  of  self-insurance  under  this subdivision the registrant shall pay annually in addition to  any other fee prescribed by this chapter, a fee of one dollar and  fifty  cents  for  each  motor vehicle registered in his name and the aggregate  amount of such fees shall be applied  in  reduction  of  the  assessment  levied pursuant to section three hundred seventeen.    As   a   further  condition  to  the  issuance  of  a  certificate  of  self-insurance, the registrant shall pay annually  in  addition  to  any  other  fee  prescribed  by  this  chapter,  an  amount per vehicle to be  determined by the Motor  Vehicle  Accident  Indemnification  Corporation  pursuant to section five thousand two hundred seven of the insurance law  and  the  aggregate  amount  of  such  fees  shall be transmitted by the  commissioner to the Motor Vehicle Accident  Indemnification  Corporation  continued  pursuant  to  section  five thousand two hundred three of the  insurance law to be applied in reduction of assessments levied  by  said  corporation  pursuant  to section five thousand two hundred seven of the  insurance law.    4.  Every person operating a motor vehicle or motorcycle as to which a  bond or policy of insurance is required by this section, which is in any  manner involved in an accident, shall  within  five  days  give  written  notice  of  the time and place of the accident to the surety or insurer.  Failure  to  give  notice  of  an  accident  as  herein  provided  shall  constitute  a  misdemeanor,  but  shall  not affect the liability of the  surety or insurer.    5. If a vehicle subject to the provisions of this section  or  section  three  hundred seventy-one of this chapter shall be operated on a public  highway without having the minimum corporate surety bond  or  policy  of  liability  insurance,  unless  the  owner  shall  have filed an approved  certificate of insurance therefor, the driver's license, privileges  and  registration  certificate or privilege of operation within this state of  the owner and operator shall be subject to revocation and suspension  as  provided  in  articles six and seven of this chapter, in the same manner  as if such vehicle were a private passenger vehicle, not used  to  carry  persons for hire or profit.    6.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commissioner, may,  by regulation, in addition to, or in lieu of any  requirements  relating  to  notice  of insurance required by this section, extend all or part of  the provisions of article  six  of  this  chapter  concerning  insurance  identification  cards  to  vehicles  subject  to  the provisions of this  section. Furthermore, the commissioner may exempt  by  such  regulations  any  type or types of vehicles subject to the provisions of this section  where he deems the application of the provisions of such regulations  to  be  inappropriate. If the commissioner promulgates any such regulations,  the failure to produce an insurance identification card  when  requested  by  any  peace  officer,  acting  pursuant to his special duties, police  officer or magistrate shall be presumptive evidence of  a  violation  of  subdivision  two  of this section. In addition, any such regulations may  require that the insurance identification card be placed in  plain  view  of any for-hire passengers carried in such vehicle.    7.  Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit any person, firm,  association or corporation  subject  to  this  section  from  purchasing  liability  insurance  coverage  in  excess  of the maximum liability set  forth in subdivision one of this section."

The filing of such final order  shall  have  the  full  force and effect of a judgment duly docketed in the office of such clerk  and  may be enforced in the same manner and with the same effect as that  provided by law in respect to executions issued  against  property  upon  judgments of a court of record.    6.

Provided, however, upon a written notice  of temporary suspension delivered by certified mail to the  licensee,  a  license  may be temporarily suspended pending a hearing. Any such notice  of temporary suspension shall provide that the suspension  is  effective  seventy-two  hours after mailing of such notice and shall provide that a  hearing be scheduled within ten days after the  effective  date  of  the  temporary suspension.

The  fee  for annual renewal thereof shall be ten  dollars. Upon renewal, the commissioner may, in his discretion, issue  a  renewal  which shall be valid for up to a two-year period. The fee for a  two-year renewal  shall  be  twenty  dollars.  Fees  for  renewal  of  a  certificate  valid for a period of less than two years shall be prorated  on a quarterly basis and any portion of a quarter shall be considered  a  quarter.    (b)  The  commissioner  or  any  employee  of  the department of motor  vehicles deputized  by  him,  may  suspend  or  revoke  an  instructor's  certificate  for any of the following causes: (1) expiration, suspension  or revocation of the  required  license  of  such  instructor;  (2)  the  commissioner  has  determined that the driving record of such instructor  indicates that  such  instructor  does  not  possess  the  qualities  or  competence  necessary  or  desirable  for a driving instructor; (3) such  instructor  has  failed  to  comply  with  the  rules  and   regulations  prescribed  by  the commissioner; (4) conviction of such instructor of a  felony or any crime involving violence, dishonesty,  deceit,  indecency,  degeneracy  or  moral turpitude; and (5) such instructor has been guilty  of fraud or fraudulent practices.    8-a.

Penalties. (a) A violation  of  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  section shall constitute a misdemeanor.    (b)  During  the  pendency  of  any  criminal prosecution based upon a  violation of this section or if any such prosecution has been terminated  and the defendant has been sentenced to pay a fine as provided  in  this  chapter,  no  proceeding  to  recover civil penalties under this section  shall be commenced and any such pending proceeding shall be stayed.    12.  Unlicensed  operation;  procedures   and   penalties.   (a)   The  commissioner or any person deputized by him shall hear and determine any  allegation  that  a  person has operated a drivers' school without being  licensed as  required  by  subdivision  two  of  this  section.  Upon  a  determination  that a person has so operated, the commissioner or person  deputized by him shall assess civil penalties as provided in  paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this subdivision.    (b)  Except  as  provided  in  paragraph  (c) of this subdivision, any  person who operates a drivers' school without being  licensed  shall  be  required  to  pay to the people of this state a civil penalty in the sum  of one thousand dollars. However, any  such  person  against  whom  such  penalty has been assessed may avoid all but five hundred dollars of such  penalty  by  obtaining  a  license as required by this section, provided  that application for such license is made not more than ten  days  after  the imposition of such penalty.    (c)  (i)  Any person who operates a drivers' school while his drivers'  school license is revoked or suspended, shall pay to the people of  this  state  a  civil  penalty  in the sum of one thousand dollars.

(d)  Civil  penalties assessed under this section shall be paid to the  commissioner for deposit into  the  state  treasury,  and  unpaid  civil  penalties  may be recovered by the commissioner in a civil action in the  name of the commissioner. In addition, as an alternative to  such  civil  action,  and  provided that no proceeding for judicial review shall then  be pending and the time for initiation of  such  proceeding  shall  have  expired,  the  commissioner may file with the county clerk of the county  in which the licensee is located  a  final  order  of  the  commissioner  containing  the amount of the penalty assessed. The filing of such final  order shall have the full force and effect of a judgment  duly  docketed  in  the  office of such clerk and may be enforced in the same manner and  with the same effect as that provided by law in  respect  to  executions  issued against property upon judgments of a court of record."

The presence in such vehicle of a radar detector  or laser detector connected  to  a  power  source  and  in  an  operable  condition  is  presumptive  evidence  of its use by any person operating  such vehicle.  Such presumption shall be rebutted by  any  credible  and  reliable  evidence which tends to show that such radar detector or laser  detector was not in use.    2.  The  provisions  of  this  section  shall  not  be  construed   as  authorizing  the  seizure  or  forfeiture  of  a radar detector or laser  detector, unless otherwise provided by law.    3.

VAT398-A,"Vehicle and Traffic      398-a. Statement  of  purpose.  The  purposes of this article are to  further highway safety by promoting the proper and efficient  repair  of  malfunctioning  or  disabled motor vehicles and to protect the consumers  of this state from dishonest, deceptive and fraudulent practices in  the  repair  of  such  motor vehicles. These purposes will be accomplished by  the enactment of legislation which require  the  registration  of  those  engaged  in  the  business of repairing malfunctioning or disabled motor  vehicles and to exclude from that business those persons who  engage  in  dishonest  or fraudulent practice or who otherwise demonstrate unfitness  for that business. That further, the  purpose  of  this  article  is  to  protect  the  motoring public from improper repairs made to its vehicles  to set standards for quality repairs to be made to  motor  vehicles  for  fair  and reasonable fees and to eliminate unqualified automotive repair  shops  from  engaging  in  the  business   of   automotive   repair   to  malfunctioning or disabled vehicles."

All such documents shall contain the name and address of the  repair shop and manufacturer, the date purchased, and the serial numbers  of the units acquired.    (d)  such  further  information  as  the  commissioner  may  by   rule  prescribe.

In the case of loss, mutilation  or  destruction  of   a   certificate   of  registration,  the  commissioner  shall  upon  application issue a duplicate certificate  thereof  upon  proof  of  the  facts.    (b)  If  a  certificate  of  registration  under this section shall be  issued in the names of two or more persons  as  partners  and  a  change  occurs  in  the  membership  of  such  partnership,  the  certificate of  registration shall not expire thereupon  so  long  as  any  one  of  the  persons  named  in  such  certificate  is a member of the partnership or  carries on the business of the partnership as surviving  member  of  the  partnership; provided, however, that when any such change occurs and the  certificate  of  registration does not expire, the partners or surviving  member after such change shall forthwith file with the commissioner  (i)  a   statement  regarding  the  change  in  such  form  and  giving  such  information as the commissioner  shall  require  or,  where  the  change  involves  the  addition  of  one  or  more  new  partners,  (ii)  a  new  application as provided in subdivision two of  this  section.

(c) If a certificate of  registration  under  this  section  shall  be  issued  and,  subsequent  thereto, the business name of any such shop is  changed, or in the event that the owners of a business incorporate  said  business  with  no change in the actual ownership and operation thereof,  such owner or owners thereof shall forthwith file with the  commissioner  a  statement  regarding  the  change  of name in such form and with such  information as the commissioner shall require.    (d) Fees assessed under this section shall be paid to the commissioner  for deposit to the general fund.    4. If an individual owner of a  registered  repair  shop  dies  or  is  adjudged  mentally  incompetent,  his  executor  or administrator or his  committee may carry on the  business  by  filing  an  amendment  to  the  application  for registration. Every corporation whose stock is not sold  to the public on a stock exchange or over-the-counter market shall  file  an  amendment to its application for registration if there is any change  in its officers, stockholders who hold more  than  ten  percent  of  the  outstanding  shares,  or  directors.  Every  repair  shop  shall file an  amendment  to  its  application  for  registration  if  it  changes  its  location.  Every such amendment shall be filed within thirty days of the  event."

If any used parts are  supplied, the invoice shall clearly state that fact.  If  any  component  system  installed  is composed of new and used parts, such invoice shall  clearly state that fact. If any body parts are  supplied  to  a  vehicle  with  a  gross vehicle weight not in excess of eighteen thousand pounds,  the invoice shall clearly state whether such parts were manufactured  as  original  equipment  parts  for  the  vehicle,  or  were manufactured as  non-original replacement parts or  are  used  parts.  One  copy  of  the  invoice shall be given to the customer and one copy shall be retained by  the  motor  vehicle  repair  shop. For the purposes of insuring that the  repairs described  on  the  work  invoice  have  been  performed,  every  customer  and  his  representative  or  a representative of an insurance  company where such company has paid or is liable  to  pay  a  claim  for  damage  to  such  customer's motor vehicle shall have a right to inspect  the repaired motor vehicle. Such right of inspection shall also  include  the  right  to inspect all replaced parts and components thereof, except  warranty  or  exchange  parts.  Provided,  however,  the  exception  for  warranty  or exchange parts from the right of inspection shall not apply  to replacement inflatable restraint systems. Any such inspection  by  an  insurer  shall  be  made in a manner consistent with the requirements of  sections two thousand six hundred one and three  thousand  four  hundred  eleven  of  the  insurance law. The motor vehicle repair shop shall make  available to the customer, upon timely written demand, or for such  work  authorized  over  the  telephone,  shall keep until the customer's motor  vehicle is  retrieved,  all  replaced  parts,  components  or  equipment  excepting  any  parts,  components  or  equipment  normally  sold  on an  exchange basis or subject to a warranty.     2. Upon the request of any customer,  a  motor  vehicle  repair  shop  shall make an estimate in writing of the parts and labor necessary for a  specific  job  and  shall  not charge for work done or parts supplied in  excess of the estimate without the consent of such customer.  The  motor  vehicle  repair shop may charge a reasonable fee for making an estimate.  If any body parts are included in the estimate  for  a  vehicle  with  a  gross  vehicle  weight  not  in  excess of eighteen thousand pounds, the  estimate shall clearly state whether such  parts  were  manufactured  as  original  equipment  parts  for  the  vehicle,  or  were manufactured as  non-original replacement parts or are used parts.    3. Each motor vehicle repair shop shall maintain such records  as  are  required  by  the regulations of the commissioner and such records shall  be available for inspection by the commissioner or his  designee  during  all  business  hours. Where a motor vehicle repair shop changes its name  or location, notification thereof shall be given to the commissioner not  more than ten days therefrom.    4. (a) Every motor vehicle repair shop shall display in a  conspicuous  place  in  such  shop  a  sign  stating: PURSUANT TO SECTION 2610 OF THE  INSURANCE LAW AN INSURANCE COMPANY MAY NOT REQUIRE THAT REPAIRS BE  MADE  TO  A  MOTOR  VEHICLE  IN  A PARTICULAR PLACE OR REPAIR SHOP. YOU HAVE A  RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR AUTOMOBILE REPAIRED IN THE SHOP OF YOUR CHOICE.    (b) Such  sign  shall  be  made  of  a  durable  material  capable  of  withstanding  outdoor  climatic  conditions,  with  the letters being at  least two inches high and having a stroke of at least one-half inch. The  letters and background shall be of contrasting colors.    5. Every person who shall write  any  auto  body  repair  estimate  on  behalf  of  a motor vehicle repair shop, whether registered or not, must  hold a  valid  estimator's  license  for  such  purpose  issued  by  the  commissioner.  The form and manner of applying for such license shall be  prescribed  by  regulation  to  be  promulgated by the commissioner. The  commissioner shall in the commissioner's discretion  establish  criteria  for  the  issuing  of  such  license.  Each  application for the license  required  hereunder  shall  be  accompanied  by  an  application  fee of  twenty-five  dollars  which  shall  in  no  event  be  refunded.  If  an  application  is  approved  by  the  commissioner,  upon  payment  by the  applicant of the additional  fee  of  one  hundred  fifty  dollars,  the  applicant  shall  be  granted  such  license  which shall be valid for a  period of three years. The renewal fee for any license  issued  pursuant  to this subdivision shall be one hundred fifty dollars.    5-a.  All  the  provisions  of section three hundred ninety-eight-f of  article twelve-A of this  chapter  shall  apply  to  the  provisions  of  subdivision  five  of  this section with the same force and effect as if  the language of those provisions had  been  incorporated  in  full  into  subdivision  five of this section and had expressly referred to the term  collision estimator licensee,  except  that  the  term  ""certificate  of  registration""  shall  be  read  as  ""estimator's  license""  and the term  ""registrant"" as ""licensee"".    6. (a) In addition to the requirements  of  subdivision  one  of  this  section,  if  an  inflatable  restraint  system  is  replaced, the motor  vehicle repair shop shall state on the repair invoice the name  and  tax  identification  number  from  whom such replacement inflatable restraint  system was purchased.

The insurer and the consumer shall receive a copy of  the purchase invoice for such replacement inflatable restraint systems.    (b) An inflatable system which has been activated in a crash or stolen  shall be  replaced  only  with  an  inflatable  restraint  system  newly  manufactured for first-time use.    (c)   Notwithstanding   the   provisions  of  paragraph  (b)  of  this  subdivision, an inflatable restraint  system  may  be  replaced  by  one  salvaged and sold by a vehicle dismantler registered pursuant to section  four  hundred  fifteen-a  of  this  chapter, provided, however, that the  salvaged inflatable restraint system has been sold  in  accordance  with  the provisions of section four hundred fifteen-c of this chapter.    (d)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provisions of law to the contrary, a  consumer has the right to seek installation  of  a  salvaged  inflatable  restraint  system  as  provided  in  paragraph  (c) of this subdivision,  provided however, nothing  shall  require  any  facility  to  install  a  salvaged  inflatable restraint system. A salvage installation shall only  be done with the specific authorization of  the  customer.  The  invoice  must  prominently state, ""Salvage inflatable restraint system."" No other  terms such as ""used"" or ""as is"" shall be used. The invoice must  clearly  state  the  terms  of  the warranty or guarantee, if given, or state ""No  warranty or guarantee given."" A  salvaged  inflatable  restraint  system  must  be  of  the exact same type as the unit with which the vehicle was  originally equipped.    (e) On and after March first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine, in no case  shall any inflatable restraint system be replaced  with  anything  other  than  a  newly  manufactured  inflatable  restraint system or a salvaged  inflatable restraint system certified according to standards established  by a nationally recognized testing, engineering  and  research  body  as  provided  for  in  subdivision  two of section four hundred fifteen-c of  this chapter.     7. Each motor vehicle repair shop which either  removes  or  installs  inflatable  restraint  systems  shall maintain a log book containing the  following information: (a) the date of  installation,  (b)  the  vehicle  identification  number,  license plate number, and make and model of the  repaired vehicle, (c) the replacement inflatable restraint system's part  number,  (d)  in the case of a salvaged inflatable restraint system, (1)  the  vehicle  identification  number  of  the  vehicle  from  which  the  replacement  inflatable restraint system was salvaged, and (2) the name,  tax identification number, and registration  number  of  the  automobile  dismantler  from  whom  such  salvaged  inflatable  restraint system was  purchased, (e) in the case of a  new  replacement  inflatable  restraint  system,  the  name  and  tax identification number of the supplier. Such  records shall be maintained in a  manner  and  form  prescribed  by  the  commissioner.  Upon  request  of  an agent of the commissioner or of any  police officer and during its regular  and  usual  business  hours,  the  motor  vehicle  repair  shop  shall produce such records and permit said  agent or police officer to examine them."
VAT398-E,"Vehicle and Traffic      398-e. Suspension,  revocation  or  refusal  to  issue registration;  civil penalty; restitution; surrender of certificate of registration. 1.  Suspension, revocation or refusal to issue registration or license.  The  commissioner,  or  any person deputized by him, may deny the application  of any person for a certificate of registration or  estimator's  license  and  may  suspend or revoke the registration of any motor vehicle repair  shop or any estimator's license  issued  pursuant  to  this  article  or  refuse  to issue a renewal thereof if he determines that such applicant,  registrant or licensee:    (a) has made a material false statement or concealed a  material  fact  in connection with his application;    (b)  was  the  former  holder  of a certificate of registration issued  hereunder which was revoked or suspended by the commissioner;    (c) was, or that any officer, director, partner or stockholder holding  more than ten percent of the outstanding stock was an officer, director,  partner or stockholder holding more than ten percent of the  outstanding  stock in a corporation or partnership, as the case may be, which was the  former  holder  of  a certificate of registration issued hereunder which  was revoked or suspended by the commissioner;    (d) has failed to furnish satisfactory  evidence  of  good  character,  reputation and fitness;    (e) does not have a place of business as required by this article;    (f)  is not the true owner of the repair shop, except in the case of a  franchise;    (g) has been guilty of fraud or fraudulent or deceptive practices;    (h) has been grossly negligent on  two  or  more  occasions  within  a  period  of  two  years  in  the  performance of any repair or adjustment  covered by this article, or has  grossly  overcharged  on  two  or  more  occasions within a period of two years for such repair or adjustment;    (i)  has  wilfully failed to comply with any of the provisions of this  article or the rules and regulations  of  the  commissioner  promulgated  hereunder;    (j) has knowingly issued a false or misleading estimate; or    (k)  has  engaged in a course of conduct which unreasonably impedes or  delays a consumer's right to a fair recovery pursuant to the  provisions  of  an  automobile  insurance  policy,  the insurance law or regulations  issued  by  the  superintendent  of  financial  services  governing  the  evaluation and adjustments of claims.    For  the  purposes  of  paragraphs  (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of this  subdivision, it shall be presumed that the actions of any employee of  a  motor vehicle repair shop shall be attributable to, and deemed to be the  actions of, such motor vehicle repair shop.    2. Civil penalty; suspension for failure to pay. (a) The commissioner,  or  any  person deputized by him, may, by order, require a registrant or  an unregistered repair shop to pay to the people of this state a penalty  as hereinafter provided. Such penalty may be imposed in addition  to  or  in  lieu  of revoking or suspending the certificate of registration of a  registrant in accordance with the provisions of this article, or such  a  penalty  may  be  imposed  upon  a  finding  that  a  registrant  or  an  unregistered  repair  shop:  (i)  has  been  grossly  negligent  in  the  performance of any repair or adjustment covered by this article; or (ii)  has grossly overcharged for such repair or adjustment.    (b) Such penalty for a first violation shall be in a sum not exceeding  seven  hundred  fifty  dollars  for  each  violation  found to have been  committed, and for a second or subsequent violation not arising  out  of  the same incident both of which were committed within a period of thirty  months,  be  in  a  sum  of  not more than one thousand dollars for each  violation found to have been committed; provided, however,  the  penalty  for  each  and any violation of paragraph (g) of subdivision one of this  section found to have been committed shall be no less than three hundred  and fifty dollars and no more than one thousand dollars, except that  if  a  finding of financial loss has been made pursuant to subdivision three  of this section, the amount of such penalty  may  be  increased  by  the  amount of financial loss so found.    (c) Upon the failure of a registrant or an unregistered repair shop to  pay such penalty, or, where the order so permits, to make restitution as  provided  in subdivision three of this section, within thirty days after  the mailing of such order, postage prepaid, registered or certified, and  addressed to the last known place of  business  of  such  registrant  or  unregistered  repair  shop,  unless  such order is stayed as provided in  subdivision three  of  section  three  hundred  ninety-eight-f  of  this  chapter,  the commissioner may revoke the certificate of registration of  such registrant or may suspend the  same  for  such  period  as  he  may  determine  or  may  seek  to  recover  unpaid civil penalties in a civil  action in the name of the commissioner. Civil penalties  assessed  under  this  subdivision shall be paid to the commissioner for deposit into the  state treasury.    (d) In addition, as an alternative to such civil action  and  provided  that  no  proceeding  for  judicial review shall then be pending and the  time  for  initiation  of  such  proceeding  shall  have  expired,   the  commissioner  may  file with the county clerk of the county in which the  registrant is located a final order of the commissioner  containing  the  amount  of  the  penalty  assessed. The filing of such final order shall  have the full force and effect of a judgment duly docketed in the office  of such clerk and may be enforced in the same manner and with  the  same  effect  as  that provided by law in respect to executions issued against  property upon judgments of a court of record.    3. Restitution; assessment. (a) Upon a determination that a registrant  or an unregistered repair shop has done or failed  to  do  any  act  for  which  suspension  of  the  registrant's registration or a civil penalty  against the registrant or unregistered repair shop could be imposed, the  person making such determination may make a finding of financial loss to  any complainant or  complainants  resulting  from  the  actions  of  the  registrant  or  unregistered repair shop. The person making such finding  may provide that if the registrant or  unregistered  repair  shop  makes  restitution to the complainant or complainants for the amount or amounts  so found, that payment of such restitution may be substituted in lieu of  any  suspension or civil penalty, or a specified portion thereof imposed  upon the registrant or unregistered repair shop. However, a  finding  of  financial  loss  shall  only  be  made  if the complainant (i) agrees to  accept the amount so found, if offered by the registrant or unregistered  repair shop, and (ii) is not a party to any litigation which is  pending  or  which  has  gone  to  judgment in relation to the same matter in any  civil court.    (b) The amount of financial loss which may be found  and  proposed  as  restitution  shall  be  limited  to  an  amount  necessary to repair the  vehicle or vehicles in question and/or any amount  of  overcharge  which  may be found. Neither punitive nor incidental damages may be included in  the finding of financial loss.    (c) If payment of restitution to the complainant is authorized in lieu  of  all  or a portion of a suspension or civil penalty, in order for the  registrant or unregistered repair shop to exercise the  option  to  make  such payment, such payment must be made by means of a certified check or  money  order  payable to the complainant or complainants delivered to an  office of the department as directed by the commissioner  or  his  agent  within  thirty  days  of  the  date of notice of suspension and/or civil  penalty. Upon receipt of  such  certified  check  or  money  order,  the  department shall forward the same to the complainant or complainants. In  the event that the registrant or unregistered repair shop should fail to  make  payment  for  restitution within such thirty days, but, at a later  time, pays such civil penalty, the department  shall  deduct  from  such  civil  penalty  payment  the  amount assessed for restitution, and shall  mail a check for such amount to the complainant or complainants.    (d) If payment of restitution may be substituted in lieu  of  a  civil  penalty   or   portion  of  a  civil  penalty,  and  the  registrant  or  unregistered repair shop does not  exercise  the  option  to  make  such  payment, the civil penalty becomes due as provided in subdivision two of  this  section  and  the  provisions  of  that  subdivision  relating  to  suspension of registration and recovery of civil penalties shall apply.    (e) Any payment made in compliance with such a  finding  of  financial  loss  shall  not  preclude  any civil action which may be brought by the  complainant, registrant  or  unregistered  repair  shop,  and  any  such  finding may be considered but shall not be binding upon any court before  which any such action is brought.    4.

Appeals. (a) The review  board  will  review  and  determine  all  appeals  filed  pursuant  to this article.  Such determination may be to  affirm, reverse or modify  the  initial  determination  of  the  hearing  officer,  or  to  remand  the  case  for  a further hearing to determine  additional facts.  Any review by such board shall be based solely on the  record upon which the initial determination is made and upon any written  brief  which  may  be  submitted  by  or  on  behalf of the applicant or  registrant.

(2) No appeal shall be reviewed unless it is  submitted  within  sixty  days  after  written notice of the determination appealed from is mailed  to the registrant or applicant.    (3)  Any person desiring to appeal pursuant to this article  shall  do  so  in  a  form and manner as provided by regulations promulgated by the  commissioner.

Such  review  shall be made and decided as expeditiously as possible; provided  that an appeal of  an  order  directing  the  sealing  of  the  premises  pursuant  to  subdivision five-a of section three hundred ninety-eight-i  of this article shall, to the extent possible, be  given  priority  over  all other appeals filed pursuant to this article.    (c)    Whenever  the  same  facts give rise to a hearing involving any  other license or registration issued by  the  commissioner,  a  combined  hearing   may   be  held.    If  the  registrant  appeals  only  from  a  determination made with respect to  his  repair  shop  registration,  he  shall  be  entitled  to  a review as provided in subdivision one of this  section; however, if he appeals from any determination or determinations  made with respect to any other license or registration,  as  well  as  a  determination  with respect to his repair shop registration, the appeals  procedure established in  article  three-A  of  this  chapter  shall  be  followed  in  lieu  of the procedure established in subdivision three of  this section.    4.

(c) Orders of the commissioner issued pursuant  to  paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision  shall  be  conspicuously  posted at the premises upon  which unlawful operation occurred.    (d) An order of the commissioner issued pursuant to paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision  shall be stayed with respect to any person who, prior  to service of the notice required by such  paragraph,  has  submitted  a  complete  application,  in  proper form and accompanied by the requisite  fee, for a certificate of registration to operate a motor vehicle repair  shop or a renewal thereof, while the application is pending.

(j)  Removal  of  the  seal  on  any  premises  sealed pursuant to the  provisions of this subdivision shall constitute a misdemeanor.    6.

In order that this section  may  not  be  used  for  the  purpose  of  evasion  of  registration  fees,  the administrators of the  contracting states may make the final decision as  to  the  proper  base  state,  in  accordance  with Article III (h) hereof, to prevent or avoid  such evasion.

General Provisions.    (a)  Effect on Other Agreements, Arrangements, and Understandings.  On  and after  its  effective  date,  this  agreement  shall  supersede  any  reciprocal or other agreement, arrangement, or understanding between any  two or more of the contracting states covering, in whole or in part, any  of  the  matters covered by this agreement; but this agreement shall not  affect any reciprocal or other agreement, arrangement, or  understanding  between  a  contracting  state and a state or states not a party to this  agreement.

The administrator shall immediately give notice of any  such violation and withdrawal of any such benefits or privileges to  the  administrator  of each other contracting state in which vehicles of such  owner are operated.    (g) Cooperation. The administrator of each of the  contracting  states  shall   cooperate  with  the  administrators  of  the  others  and  each  contracting state hereby agrees to furnish such aid  and  assistance  to  each  other  within  its  statutory  authority as will aid in the proper  enforcement of this agreement.

In any dispute between or among contracting states  arising   under   this   agreement,   the   final   decision   regarding  interpretation of questions at issue relating to this agreement shall be  reached  by  joint  action of the contracting states, acting through the  administrator  thereof,  and  shall  upon  determination  be  placed  in  writing.    (i)  Effect of Headings.

If the statutes of any state so authorize or  provide, such  state  may  become  party  to  this  agreement  upon  the  execution  thereof  by  an  executive or administrative official thereof  acting on behalf of and for such state.                   ARTICLE IV. Proration of Registration.    (a) Applicability. Any owner of a fleet may  register  the  busses  of  said  fleet  in  any  contracting  state  by  paying to said state total  registration fees in an amount equal to that obtained  by  applying  the  proportion  of in-state fleet miles divided by the total fleet miles, to  the  total  fees  which  would  otherwise  be   required   for   regular  registration of each and all of such vehicles in such contracting state.    All  fleet  pro-rata registration fees shall be based upon the mileage  proportions of the fleet during the period of twelve  months  ending  on  August  thirty-first next preceding the commencement of the registration  year for which registration is sought, except, that mileage  proportions  for  a  fleet  not  operated  during  such  period  in  the  state where  application  for  registration  is  made  will  be  determined  by   the  administrator  upon  the  sworn application of the applicant showing the  operations  during  such  period  in  other  states  and  the  estimated  operations  during  the  registration  year  for  which  registration is  sought, in the state in which  application  is  being  made;  or  if  no  operations  were  conducted  during  such period a full statement of the  proposed method of operation.    If any busses operate in two or more states which permit the proration  of registration on the basis of a fleet of busses consisting of a lesser  number of vehicles than provided in Article II (g), such  fleet  may  be  prorated as to registration in such states, in which event the busses in  such  fleet  shall  not be required to register in any other contracting  states if each such vehicle is  registered  in  some  contracting  state  except  to  the  extent  it  is  exempt from registration as provided in  Article III (b).    If the administrator of any state determines, based on his  method  of  the  operation  thereof, that the inclusion of a bus or busses as a part  of a fleet would adversely affect the proper fleet fee which  should  be  paid  to  his  state,  having due regard for fairness and equity, he may  refuse to permit any or all of such busses to be included in  his  state  as a part of such fleet.    (b)  Total  Fleet  Miles.  Total  fleet  miles,  with  respect to each  contracting state, shall mean the total miles operated by the fleet  (1)  in  such state, (2) in all other contracting states, (3) in other states  having proportional registration provisions, (4) in  states  with  which  such  contracting state has reciprocity, and (5) in such other states as  the administrator determines should be included under the  circumstances  in order to protect or promote the interest of his state; except that in  states  having  laws  requiring  proration  on  the basis of a different  determination  of  total  fleet  miles,  total  fleet  miles  shall   be  determined on such basis.    (c)  Leased  Vehicles. If a bus is operated by a person other than the  owner as a part of a fleet which is subject to the  provisions  of  this  article, then the operator of such fleet shall be deemed to be the owner  of said bus for the purposes of this article.    (d)  Extent  of  Privileges.  Upon  the  registration  of a fleet in a  contracting state pursuant to this article, each bus in the fleet may be  operated in both interstate and  intrastate  operations  in  such  state  except as provided in Article III (e).    (e)  Application  for  Proration.  The  application  for  proration of  registration shall be made in each contracting state upon  substantially  the  application forms and supplements authorized by joint action of the  administrators of the contracting states.    (f) Issuance of Identification. Upon  registration  of  a  fleet,  the  state  which  is  the base state of a particular bus of the fleet, shall  issue the required license plates and registration card for such bus and  each contracting state in which the fleet of which such bus is  a  part,  operates, shall issue a special identification identifying such bus as a  part  of  a  fleet  which  has  fully  complied  with  the  registration  requirements of such state. The required  license  plates,  registration  cards  and identification shall be appropriately displayed in the manner  required by or pursuant to the laws of each respective state.    (g) Additions to Fleet. If any bus is added to a prorated fleet  after  the  filing  of  the  original  application,  the  owner  shall  file  a  supplemental application.  The owner shall register  such  bus  in  each  contracting  state  in  like  manner as provided for busses listed in an  original  application  and  the  registration  fee  payable   shall   be  determined  on the mileage proportion used to determine the registration  fees payable for busses registered under the original application.    (h) Withdrawals from Fleet. If any bus is withdrawn  from  a  prorated  fleet  during  the  period for which it is registered or identified, the  owner shall notify the administrator  of  each  state  in  which  it  is  registered  or  identified,  of  such  withdrawal  and  shall return the  plates, and registration card or identification as may be required by or  pursuant to the laws of the respective states.    (i) Audits. The administrator of each contracting state shall,  within  the  statutory  authority  of  such  administrator, make any information  obtained upon an audit of records of  any  applicant  for  proration  of  registration  available  to  the administrators of the other contracting  states.    (j) Errors in Registration. If it is determined by  the  administrator  of a contracting state, as a result of such audits or otherwise, that an  improper  fee  has been paid his state, or errors in registration found,  the administrator may require the fleet  owner  to  make  the  necessary  corrections in the registration of his fleet and payment of fees.                           ARTICLE V. Reciprocity.    (a)  Grant  of  Reciprocity.  Each  of  the  contracting states grants  reciprocity as provided in this article.    (b) Applicability. The provisions of this agreement  with  respect  to  reciprocity  shall  apply  only to a bus properly registered in the base  state of the bus, which state must be a contracting state.    (c) Non-applicability  to  Fleet  Busses.    The  reciprocity  granted  pursuant  to  this article shall not apply to a bus which is entitled to  be registered or identified as part of a prorated fleet.    (d) Extent of Reciprocity. The reciprocity granted  pursuant  to  this  article  shall  permit  the interstate operation of a bus and intrastate  operation which is incidental to a trip of such bus involving interstate  operation.    (e) Other Agreements. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed  to  prohibit  any  of  the  contracting  states  from entering into separate  agreements with each other for the granting of temporary permits for the  intrastate operation of vehicles registered in the other state;  nor  to  prevent  any  of the contracting states from entering into agreements to  grant reciprocity for intrastate operation  within  any  zone  or  zones  agreed upon by the states.                    ARTICLE VI. Withdrawal or Revocation.    Any  contracting  state  may  withdraw from this agreement upon thirty  days written notice to each other contracting state, which notice  shall  be  given  only after the repeal of this agreement by the legislature of  such state, if adoption was by legislative act, or after renunciation by  the appropriate administrative official of such contracting state if the  laws thereof empower him so to renounce.                 ARTICLE VII. Construction and Severability.    This compact shall be liberally construed  so  as  to  effectuate  the  purposes  thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and  if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared  to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United  States  or  the  applicability  thereof  to  any  government,  agency, person or  circumstance is held invalid, the validity  of  the  remainder  of  this  compact  and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person  or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall  be  held contrary to the constitution of any state participating herein, the  compact  shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party  states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as  to  all  severable matters."

Any such exemption or change  shall be made by rule or regulation and shall not  be  effective  unless  made  by  the same procedure required for other rules and regulations of  his department. If not otherwise covered by statute,  the  administrator  may  make  provision  for  publication  of  the  rules  and  regulations  contemplated by this section."

All such documents shall contain the name and address of the  repair shop and manufacturer, the date purchased, and the serial numbers  of the units acquired. The application shall also contain  the  business  address  of the applicant and may contain any other information required  by the commissioner.    3. Fees.

Upon  approval  of  an  application,  an  appropriate  registration shall be issued for a period  of  time  determined  by  the  commissioner  and  if issued for a period of more or less than one year,  the  fee  shall be prorated on a monthly basis. Fees assessed under this  section shall be paid to the commissioner for  deposit  to  the  general  fund.    4.  Requirements  for  registration.

However,  the  commissioner   may   issue   a   temporary  registration  pending  final  investigation of an application.    (b) The provisions of this subdivision requiring a place  of  business  at  which  the  activity  requiring  registration is performed shall not  apply to a mobile car crusher nor to  an  itinerant  vehicle  collector.  However,  the  mobile  car  crusher  or itinerant vehicle collector must  otherwise comply with all applicable local licensing laws or ordinances.    (c)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  paragraph   (a)   of   this  subdivision,  the  commissioner may issue a registration to an applicant  for registration as a vehicle dismantler or salvage pool to a person who  may not comply with local laws relating  to  zoning  provided  that  the  applicant  has  engaged  in  business  at  that  location  as  a vehicle  dismantler  since  September  first,  nineteen  hundred   seventy-three.  However,  the  issuance of such registration shall not be a defense with  respect to any action brought with respect  to  violation  of  any  such  local law.    5.  Records  and  identification.    (a)  Any records required by this  section shall apply only to vehicles or parts of vehicles  for  which  a  certificate  of title has been issued by the commissioner or which would  be eligible to have such a certificate of  title  issued.  Every  person  required  to  be  registered  pursuant  to this section shall maintain a  record of all  motor  vehicles,  trailers,  and  major  component  parts  thereof,  coming  into  his  possession  together  with  a record of the  disposition of any such motor vehicle, trailer or part thereof  and  the  date  such  motor vehicle, trailer or part thereof is received and shall  maintain proof of ownership for any  motor  vehicle,  trailer  or  major  component part thereof while in his possession. For the purposes of this  article  an inflatable restraint system shall be a major component part.  Such records shall be maintained in a manner and form prescribed by  the  commissioner.  The  commissioner  may, by regulation, exempt vehicles or  major component parts of vehicles from all or a portion  of  the  record  keeping   requirements  based  upon  the  age  of  the  vehicle  if  the  commissioner deems that  such  record  keeping  requirements  would  not  further  the  purposes  of  the  motor  vehicle theft prevention program  established by section two hundred twenty-three of this chapter.    Upon  request  of  an  agent  of the commissioner or of any police officer and  during his regular and usual business hours, a vehicle dismantler  shall  produce  such records and permit said agent or police officer to examine  them and any vehicles or parts of vehicles  which  are  subject  to  the  record  keeping  requirements  of  this  section  and  which  are on the  premises. Upon request of any agent of the commissioner and  during  his  regular  and usual business hours, a salvage pool, mobile car crusher or  itinerant vehicle collector shall produce such records and  permit  said  agent  or  police  officer  to examine them and any vehicles or parts of  vehicles which are subject to the record keeping  requirements  of  this  section  and  which  are  on  the  premises. The failure to produce such  records or to permit such inspection on the part of any person  required  to  be registered pursuant to this section as required by this paragraph  shall be a class A misdemeanor.    (b) Every vehicle dismantler and salvage pool  shall  display  at  his  place  of  business at least one sign upon which his registration number  and any other information required by the commissioner is affixed  in  a  manner  prescribed  by  the  commissioner  and  further  shall affix his  registration number on all advertising,  business  cards,  and  vehicles  used  by him in connection with his business. The commissioner is hereby  empowered to  require,  by  regulation,  that  vehicle  dismantlers  and  salvage  pools  mark,  stamp or tag major component parts of vehicles in  their possession in a manner prescribed by the  commissioner  so  as  to  enable  the  part  so  marked  to  be  identified  as having come from a  particular vehicle and from a particular vehicle dismantler and  salvage  pool. A violation of this paragraph shall be a class A misdemeanor.    5-a. Improper display of signs. (a) The holder of a vehicle dismantler  or  salvage  pool  registration  shall remove or cause to be removed any  sign which contains the license number of the facility which is  visible  to  the  public and which is required to be displayed by this article or  regulations promulgated thereunder if the  registration  is  revoked  or  suspended  or the vehicle dismantler or salvage pool is out of business.  If the registration is only suspended, the holder may cover up the  sign  instead of removing it.    (b)  No  person  shall  permit  the display of any sign required to be  displayed  by  this  article  or  regulations   promulgated   thereunder  indicating  to the public that an official vehicle dismantler or salvage  pool is operating unless a dismantler or salvage pool  registration  has  been issued to that person and is currently valid.    6.  Suspension,  revocation and refusal to renew a registration; civil  penalty.  (a) A registration may be suspended or revoked, or renewal  of  a  registration  refused upon a conviction of any provision of the penal  law relating to motor vehicle theft,  illegal  possession  of  a  stolen  vehicle  or  illegal  possession of stolen motor vehicle parts, or after  the registrant has had an opportunity to be heard  upon  any  change  of  status of the registrant which would have resulted in refusal to issue a  registration,  any false statement in an application for a registration,  an egregious and willful violation  of  title  twenty-three  of  article  twenty-seven  of  the  environmental  conservation law, any violation of  subdivision five of this  section  or  regulations  promulgated  by  the  commissioner with respect to this section, or any violation of title ten  of this chapter.    (b)  Civil  penalty. The commissioner, or any person deputized by him,  in addition to or in lieu of revoking or suspending the registration  of  a  registrant  in accordance with the provisions of this article, may in  any one proceeding by order require the registrant to pay to the  people  of  this  state  a  civil  penalty  in  a sum not exceeding one thousand  dollars for each violation and upon the failure of  such  registrant  to  pay  such  penalty  within  twenty days after the mailing of such order,  postage prepaid, registered or certified,  and  addressed  to  the  last  known  place of business of such registrant, unless such order is stayed  by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, the  commissioner  may  revoke  the  registration of such registrant or may suspend the same for  such period as he may determine. Civil  penalties  assessed  under  this  subdivision shall be paid to the commissioner for deposit into the state  treasury,   and   unpaid   civil  penalties  may  be  recovered  by  the  commissioner in a civil action in the name of the commissioner.    (c) In addition, as an alternative to such civil action  and  provided  that  no  proceeding  for  judicial review shall then be pending and the  time  for  initiation  of  such  proceeding  shall  have  expired,   the  commissioner  may  file with the county clerk of the county in which the  registrant  is  located a final order of the commissioner containing the  amount of the penalty assessed. The filing of  such  final  order  shall  have the full force and effect of a judgment duly docketed in the office  of  such  clerk and may be enforced in the same manner and with the same  effect as that provided by law in respect to executions  issued  against  property upon judgments of a court of record.    7.  Registration  as  a  dealer and as a vehicle dismantler or salvage  pool. A person may be registered as a dealer under section four  hundred  fifteen  of  this  chapter  as well as a vehicle dismantler or a salvage  pool under this section. However, any such person must obtain a separate  registration for each activity and must maintain  separate  records  for  each activity.    8.  Vehicle  rebuilders. (a) A vehicle rebuilder is any person engaged  in the business  of  acquiring  damaged  vehicles  for  the  purpose  of  repairing  and  reselling  such  vehicles.

(b) A vehicle rebuilder shall maintain a record  of  all  vehicles  or  major component parts thereof coming into his possession for the purpose  of rebuilding and all major component parts used in connection with such  rebuilding  in  a manner prescribed by the commissioner. Upon request of  an agent of the commissioner or any police officer  during  his  regular  and usual business hours, a vehicle rebuilder shall produce such records  and permit said agent or police officer to examine them and any vehicles  or   parts   of  vehicles  which  are  subject  to  the  record  keeping  requirements of this section and which are on the premises. The  failure  to  produce  such  records  or  to permit such records or to permit such  inspection as required by this paragraph shall be a class A misdemeanor.    9. Scrap processor. (a) A scrap processor is any person required to be  licensed under article six-C of the general business law  who  purchases  material  which  is  or  may  have  been  a  vehicle or vehicle part for  processing into a form other than a vehicle or vehicle  part,  but  who,  except as otherwise provided by regulation of the commissioner, does not  sell  any  such  material  as  a  motor  vehicle,  a  trailer or a major  component part thereof. No person shall engage in business or operate as  a scrap processor as defined in  this  paragraph  unless  he  has  given  notice  to the commissioner that he is a scrap processor and that he has  complied with article six-C of the general business law, and he has been  certified by the commissioner as a scrap processor. A violation of  this  paragraph shall be a class A misdemeanor.    (b) A scrap processor shall maintain a record of vehicles and a record  of major component parts by weight coming into his possession thereof in  a  manner prescribed by the commissioner. This paragraph shall not apply  to any major component part included in a mixed load. Upon request of an  agent of the commissioner or any police officer or  during  his  regular  and  usual  business hours, a scrap processor shall produce such records  and permit such agent or police officer to inspect them and  to  inspect  any  vehicles  or  major  component parts of vehicles at the time of the  delivery of such vehicles or parts to him. The failure to  produce  such  records or to permit such inspection as required by this paragraph shall  be a class A misdemeanor.    10.  Scrap  collectors  and repair shops. (a) A scrap collector is any  person, other than a governmental agency, whose primary business is  the  collection  of  miscellaneous scrap for disposal, who may as an incident  of such business collect vehicular  parts  as  scrap.  No  person  shall  engage  in  the  business  or operate as a scrap collector as defined in  this paragraph unless he has given notice to the commissioner that he is  a  scrap  collector  and  has been certified as a scrap collector by the  commissioner.  A  violation  of  this  provision  shall  be  a  class  A  misdemeanor.  No person shall be certified as a scrap collector eligible  to do business within a city having a population of one million or more,  or any county contiguous to such city, unless such person complies  with  all local requirements applicable to such business.    (b)  If  required by regulation of the commissioner, a scrap collector  shall keep records of his acquisition and disposition of vehicular scrap  in a manner prescribed by the commissioner. Upon request of an agent  of  the  commissioner or any police officer, a scrap collector shall produce  such records as may be required to be kept  and  permit  said  agent  or  police  officer  to  inspect  them  during usual business hours or while  business is being conducted. The failure  to  produce  such  records  as  required by this paragraph shall be a class A misdemeanor.    (c)  A  repair  shop  registered  pursuant to article twelve-A of this  chapter which disposes of vehicular scrap to a certified scrap processor  shall apply to the commissioner for  certification  to  carry  out  this  disposal.   The  repair  shop  shall  include  in  the  application  for  certification the names and addresses of  those  scrap  processors  with  whom  it  arranges  for the disposal of its scrap. Thereafter the repair  shop shall give notice to the commissioner within  thirty  days  of  any  change in the scrap processors with whom it deals. The failure to comply  with this paragraph or to make fraudulent statements regarding the scrap  processors  with  which  a  repair  shop  arranges  for  the disposal of  vehicular scrap shall be a class A misdemeanor.    11.

The  commissioner  may  also revoke or suspend registration or certification,  after an appropriate hearing where the holder  of  the  registration  or  certification has had an opportunity to be heard, upon a finding of: (a)  that  there  has  been  a change to the holder's status which would have  resulted in a refusal to issue in the first instance, or  (b)  that  the  issuance  was  based  upon  a false statement by the holder, or (c) that  there was a violation of the record keeping requirements,  or  (d)  that  there was a violation of the regulations promulgated by the commissioner  pursuant  to  this section, or (e) that there was a violation of title X  of this chapter.    14.

It shall be unlawful  after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-three for any  manufacturer  to  sell  or  lease  or  to offer to sell or lease in this state for the  purpose of registration in this  state  any  new  passenger  type  motor  vehicle  manufactured  or  assembled  after  said  date  designated as a  nineteen hundred ninety-three or subsequent model,  except  omnibus  and  multipurpose passenger vehicles, unless such vehicle has affixed thereto  a  bumper  quality  label,  placed  conspicuously  upon  that  window or  windshield where the manufacturer's suggested retail price  sticker  has  been  posted. The commissioner shall determine the size, type legibility  and placement of such label.

Minimal  damage  to  the  bumper  means  damage  that  can  be repaired with the use of a common repair materials  and without replacing any parts.  The  stronger  the  bumper,  the  less  likely the car will require repair after a low-speed collision.""    2. The impact speed required to be specified in the notice pursuant to  subdivision  one of this section is the maximum speed of impact upon the  bumper of the vehicle at which the vehicle sustains  no  damage  to  the  body  and  safety  systems  and  only  minimal damage to the bumper when  subjected to the fixed barrier  and  pendulum  impact  tests,  and  when  subjected  to  the  corner impact test at not less than sixty percent of  that maximum speed, conducted pursuant to the practices, procedures  and  regulations  promulgated  under  the concurrent authority of the Federal  Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings  Act  (Cost  Savings  Act)(15  U.S.C.  1901  et seq.) and the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety  Act (15 U.S.C. 1381, et seq.)    3.

(b) The commissioner shall establish standards for determining whether  an identification number on a motor vehicle, trailer or part thereof  is  destroyed,  removed, altered, defaced or so covered as to be effectually  concealed. Whenever  a  vehicle  described  in  paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision is seized or confiscated, members of the state police, local  police  department  or  peace  officers acting pursuant to their special  duties, if warranted, shall  arrest  the  supposed  owner  or  custodian  thereof,  and  cause  prosecution  to be brought in a court of competent  jurisdiction.  It shall be the duty of the  appropriate  agency  or  the  department  of  motor  vehicles  to  retain  the  custody  of each motor  vehicle, trailer or part seized pending the prosecution  of  the  person  arrested  until  the  ownership  of  such motor vehicle, trailer or part  shall have been ascertained. If the ownership  of  such  motor  vehicle,  trailer  or  part cannot be ascertained, or if the owner or custodian is  convicted of the theft or unlawful possession  of  said  motor  vehicle,  trailer  or  part,  such  motor  vehicle,  trailer  or  part,  if in the  possession of the state police or any other state agency shall,  at  the  direction  of  the office of general services, be held for, or delivered  into the possession of, such  office,  and  title  shall  vest  in  such  office,  or  if  in the possession of a local police department or other  local authority, such motor vehicle or trailer shall be  treated  as  an  abandoned vehicle pursuant to section twelve hundred twenty-four of this  chapter, or such part may be sold by the local authority to a registered  dealer  or  to  a  registered  vehicle  dismantler  or  certified  scrap  processor as  defined  in  subdivision  nine  of  section  four  hundred  fifteen-a of this chapter.    2.  Assignment  of a new identification number. If a person other than  the person arrested be the owner, the motor  vehicle,  trailer  or  part  shall  be  returned  to  him  as  soon  as  he  has arranged to have the  department of motor vehicles affix a new number, or in  the  case  of  a  part,  inspect such part, and the department has done so, as provided in  section four hundred twenty-two of this chapter. Prior to the return  of  the  motor  vehicle, trailer or part, or the transfer of custody of said  motor vehicle, trailer or part, the  arresting  officer  shall  transmit  notice of the arrest to the commissioner.    3.  Disposition  of certain motor vehicles, trailers and parts. (a) If  the owner of a motor vehicle or trailer cannot be ascertained, or if the  owner or custodian is arrested and convicted of the  theft  or  unlawful  possession  of  said motor vehicle or trailer, and such motor vehicle or  trailer is held for or is in the possession of  the  office  of  general  services, the office of general services shall sell the motor vehicle or  trailer at public auction or by bid, or, it may be registered for use by  the  office or by a state agency in the performance of the duties of the  office or of such state agency, provided that the  department  of  motor  vehicles  first  affixes  a  special  identification number to the motor  vehicle or trailer, if required. The special identification number shall  thereafter be used for identification, registration and all purposes  of  this  chapter, and the purchaser thereof may sell and transfer the motor  vehicle or trailer bearing  such  a  special  identification  number  or  numbers.    (b)  If  the  owner  of  a part or parts of a motor vehicle or trailer  cannot be ascertained, or if the owner  or  custodian  is  arrested  and  convicted  of the theft or unlawful possession thereof, and such part is  held for or is in the possession of the office of general services,  the  office of general services shall sell such part or parts to a registered  dealer  or  to  a  registered  vehicle  dismantler  or a certified scrap  processor as  defined  in  subdivision  nine  of  section  four  hundred  fifteen-a of this chapter.    (c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, ownership of  an unidentifiable part in an otherwise identifiable vehicle, other  than  a  stolen  vehicle, held by the department or by a police department may  be transferred to the owner of such vehicle provided that the department  or police department has made findings that such owner had no  knowledge  that  the  part  was  unidentifiable  and  that  such  owner was neither  responsible for rendering such part unidentifiable nor acting in concert  with any person who rendered or had such part  rendered  unidentifiable.  Such  a  transfer  may  be  made  to  a  person  who is presumed to have  determined and to know identification  numbers  on  motor  vehicles  and  parts  pursuant to subdivision one of section four hundred twenty-one of  this article only upon payment  to  the  department  or  to  the  police  department  of  an amount equal to the reasonable wholesale value of the  part. Such a transfer may be  made  to  any  other  person  without  any  payment  being made to the department or police department provided that  the department or police department is satisfied  that  the  person  has  been  the  owner  of  the vehicle with the unidentifiable part contained  therein for a period of at least eighteen months.    Such  findings  may  only be made after an investigation and, if appropriate, a hearing. Such  investigation  shall  be  made  promptly by the department or the police  department upon the request of such owner. Proceeds from the transfer of  any such part shall be paid into  the  general  fund  of  the  state  if  transferred  by  the department or the division of state police, or into  the general fund of the appropriate local authority, if transferred by a  local police department. No such part shall be so  transferred  until  a  special  identification  number  has  been  affixed to such part and the  appropriate fee has been paid by the owner of the vehicle.    4. Whenever a vehicle or part which is in the possession of the  state  police or any other state agency or a local police agency or other local  authority  is  returned  to an owner, the cost of making delivery of the  vehicle or part shall be a charge upon such owner. With respect to motor  vehicles, trailers and parts held by the state police or any other state  agency, the commissioner  of  the  office  of  general  services,  after  consultation  with  the commissioner of motor vehicles, shall promulgate  regulations  to  effectuate  the  provisions  of  this   section.   Such  regulations may include, but shall not be limited to, provisions for the  removal  of  parts  from  vehicles, the storage and sale of vehicles and  parts and the recovery  of  costs  incurred  in  performing  the  duties  required herein.    5.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the commissioner is  holding a vehicle or vehicle part, upon determination  of  the  rightful  owner  of  the  vehicle  or  vehicle  part,  the commissioner shall give  written notice to the owner to retrieve such vehicle  or  vehicle  part.  Fifteen  days  after  the  receipt of such notice by certified mail, the  commissioner shall impose a storage charge of ten dollars a  day  for  a  vehicle  and  five  dollars  a  day  for a vehicle part or parts. Unpaid  storage charges shall be a lien upon the vehicle  or  vehicle  part  and  such  lien may be foreclosed in accordance with article nine of the lien  law. Any moneys collected  as  storage  charges  or  as  the  result  of  foreclosure of liens for storage shall be used to fund the motor vehicle  theft prevention program established by section two hundred twenty-three  of this chapter."

Such  information  shall  be made available to the commissioner of motor  vehicles. The commissioner may  assist  in  providing  information  with  respect  to stolen or recovered motor vehicles, trailers and parts as he  may deem advisable.    (b) For the purposes of this subdivision the term ""impound""  shall  be  deemed  to  include the taking into possession by an agency of any motor  vehicle which has been abandoned, repossessed, seized pending forfeiture  proceedings, taken into custody or held as evidence in the course  of  a  police  investigation,  required to be impounded by law, or in any other  way taken into possession or held by an agency  under  circumstances  in  which  the  owner may not reasonably have knowledge of the status of the  vehicle. Nothing contained herein shall preclude  a  police  department,  which   has   taken   a  vehicle  into  custody  under  these  or  other  circumstances, from entering a  vehicle  into  the  New  York  statewide  police  information  network  as  an  impounded  vehicle  to  facilitate  location of the vehicle by its owner.    2. Any policeman, state trooper or peace officer  acting  pursuant  to  his  special  duties  shall have the power to seize any motor vehicle or  trailer in the state when there is good  reason  to  believe  that  such  motor  vehicle or trailer has been stolen. Unless the vehicle is subject  to the  provisions  of  section  four  hundred  twenty-three-a  of  this  article,  the  appropriate  agency shall contact the owner of such motor  vehicle or trailer, if  known,  and,  after  any  stolen  vehicle  alarm  resulting  from  such  theft  has been cancelled, release the vehicle to  such owner. If the owner thereof cannot  be  ascertained  in  accordance  with  procedures established by regulations of the commissioner, a local  police agency shall dispose of such  vehicle  as  an  abandoned  vehicle  pursuant  to section twelve hundred twenty-four of this chapter, and the  state police shall hold such vehicle for, or deliver it to the office of  general services."

Whenever a motor  vehicle for which a notice  of  acquisition  is  required  to  be  filed  pursuant  to  section  four hundred twenty-nine of this article is to be  registered for use on the public highway, the person holding  the  proof  of ownership for such vehicle must surrender such proof of ownership and  make  application  for  a  certificate  of  title.  Except  as otherwise  provided herein, the commissioner shall require the physical examination  of any such vehicle by a designated employee of the department before  a  title  will  be issued. Upon a request made with such an application for  title, the commissioner may issue a  temporary  permit  which  shall  be  valid for the operation of such vehicle upon the public highways of this  state,  in  accordance with regulations promulgated by the commissioner,  from the date of its issuance until five days after the  scheduled  date  of the examination for such vehicle, including the transportation of the  motor  vehicle  to  and from the physical examination site, provided the  application is accompanied  by  proof  of  inspection  and  evidence  of  insurance   coverage   satisfactory   to  the  commissioner.  Upon  such  examination for identification, the  employee  making  such  examination  shall,  in  accordance with regulations promulgated by the commissioner,  determine whether a  special  vehicle  identification  number  shall  be  issued  for  such  vehicle.  A fee of one hundred fifty dollars shall be  paid to the commissioner before such examination shall be  scheduled  or  made.  Such fee shall be forfeited if the motor vehicle is not presented  for examination as scheduled unless the appointment for such examination  has  been  cancelled  or  postponed  in  accordance   with   regulations  promulgated  by  the  commissioner.  If a special vehicle identification  number is issued after such examination,  no  additional  fee  shall  be  required for such issuance.    2.  The  provisions  of  subdivision  one  of this section relating to  inspection for identification by an employee of the department shall not  apply to a motor vehicle which has  been  transferred  to  an  insurance  company in settlement of a claim for the theft of such vehicle, provided  the following conditions are met:    (i)  no  major  component  part of the motor vehicle has been replaced  since the theft of such vehicle,    (ii) repairs made to the motor vehicle  since  the  recovery  of  such  vehicle  either  have  not exceeded one-fourth of the amount paid by the  insurance company in settlement of the claim or have  not  exceeded  one  thousand dollars,    (iii)  the  vehicle identification number and all other manufacturers'  identifying numbers on the motor  vehicle  have  been  examined  by  the  insurance  company and are intact in the same form as at the time of the  theft of such vehicle,    (iv) an affidavit sworn to by an officer of the insurance  company  is  submitted  by  the insurance company which made payment in settlement of  the claim for theft with the application for  title  certifying  to  the  above conditions, which affidavit shall also certify additional facts as  required  by the commissioner relating to the theft and recovery of such  vehicle and the amount of settlement and repair costs.    3. The commissioner may,  by  regulation,  exempt  vehicles  from  the  physical  examination  required by subdivision one of this section based  upon the age of  the  vehicles  if  the  commissioner  deems  that  such  physical examination would not further the purposes of the motor vehicle  theft prevention program established by section two hundred twenty-three  of this chapter.    4.  Fees; deposited. Fees assessed under this section shall be paid to  the commissioner for deposit to the general fund, with the exception  of  the  fifty  dollar  increase  in  the  fee for scheduling an examination  pursuant to subdivision one of this section, which shall be deposited to  the dedicated highway and bridge  trust  fund  established  pursuant  to  section  eighty-nine-b  of  the state finance law and the dedicated mass  transportation fund established pursuant to section eighty-nine-c of the  state  finance  law  and  distributed  according  to  the  provisions of  subdivision (d) of section three hundred one-j of the tax law."

The  commissioner  may  refuse  to  register  or  issue  a  certificate  of  title for a vehicle made by a manufacturer or assembler  who fails to comply with this section.    2.

VAT465,"Vehicle and Traffic      465. Procedures  relating  to  warranties and sales incentives.   1.  Every franchisor shall properly fulfill any  warranty  agreement  and/or  franchisor's   service   contract  and  shall  compensate  each  of  its  franchised motor vehicle dealers for warranty parts and labor in amounts  which reflect reasonable compensation for such work. All warranty claims  and/or claims under a franchisor's service contract made  by  franchised  motor  vehicle  dealers shall be paid within thirty days following their  approval. For  parts  reimbursement,  other  than  components,  systems,  fixtures,  appliances,  furnishings, accessories and features of a house  coach that are designed, used and maintained primarily for  nonvehicular  residential   purposes,   and   for   labor   reimbursement,  reasonable  compensation shall not be less than the price and rate  charged  by  the  franchised motor vehicle dealer for like services to non-warranty and/or  non-service  contract customers. For purposes of this section, the price  and rate charged by the franchised motor vehicle dealer for parts may be  established by submitting  to  the  franchisor  one  hundred  sequential  nonwarranty  customer-paid  service  repair  orders  or  the  number  of  sequential  nonwarranty  customer-paid  service  repair  orders  written  within  a ninety day period, whichever is less, covering repairs made no  more than one hundred eighty days before the submission,  and  declaring  the  price  and  rate, including average markup for the franchised motor  vehicle dealer as its reimbursement  rate.  The  reimbursement  rate  so  declared  shall go into effect thirty days following the declaration and  shall be presumed to be reasonable, however a franchisor may rebut  such  presumption  by showing that such rate so established is unreasonable in  light of the practices of all other franchised motor vehicle dealers  in  the  vicinity  offering the same line make. The franchised motor vehicle  dealer shall not request a change in the reimbursement rate  more  often  than once in each calendar year. In establishing the labor reimbursement  rate, the franchisor shall not require a franchised motor vehicle dealer  to  establish  said  rate by a methodology, or by requiring information,  that is unduly burdensome or time consuming to provide,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  a  transaction  by  transaction  calculation. For the  purposes of this section, the following parts or types of repairs  shall  be   excluded   from   the  parts  and/or  labor  calculations  and  the  franchisor's reimbursement requirements under this  section:  (a)  parts  sold  at wholesale; (b) tires; (c) routine maintenance not covered under  any retail customer warranty such  as  fluids,  filters  and  belts  not  provided  in  the course of repairs; (d) vehicle reconditioning; and (e)  batteries replaced as part of a routine maintenance  operation.  If  the  franchisor  rejects the declaration or attempts to rebut the declaration  because of an error in the dealer's  submission,  the  franchisor  shall  identify  with  specificity  the  reason  for rejection and identify the  error or errors within the  submission.  In  the  event  the  franchisor  rejects  or  rebuts  the  dealer's initial declaration, the dealer shall  have the opportunity,  within  sixty  days  to  resubmit  the  full  and  corrected  declaration addressing the alleged error or errors identified  by the franchisor. The franchisor shall respond within sixty  days.  The  one hundred eighty day requirement for the repair orders shall be stayed  from  the  date  of initial submission. In any action or proceeding held  pursuant to this subdivision, the franchisor shall have  the  burden  of  proving  that  the  rate  declared  by  the  dealer  was unreasonable as  described in this subdivision and that the proposed  adjustment  of  the  average  percentage  markup or rejection of the submission is reasonable  pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision.    2. All warranty or sales incentive claims shall be either approved  or  disapproved  within thirty days after their receipt. When any such claim  is disapproved the franchised motor vehicle dealer shall be notified  in  writing  of  its  disapproval within said period. Each such notice shall  state the specific grounds upon which the disapproval is based.  Failure  to disapprove a claim within thirty days shall be deemed approval.    3.  No  franchisor  shall conduct an audit or charge back any warranty  payment, or  any  sales,  advertising  or  marketing  incentive  payment  (""incentive  payments"")  or  otherwise  hold  a franchised motor vehicle  dealer liable for charges more than one year, or five years in the  case  of fraud, after the date the franchisor made such payment to the dealer,  without providing a notice to a franchised motor vehicle dealer of, or a  mechanism  that  makes  available  to a franchised motor vehicle dealer,  information regarding errors or issues regarding such dealer's warranty,  sales, advertising or marketing incentive claims that are the subject of  the audit or chargeback. Nothing in this  section  shall  be  deemed  to  grant  a  dealer  the  right to access any file held by the manufacturer  evaluating  such  dealer.  In  connection  with  a  claim  for  warranty  reimbursements,  the dealer's failure to document properly one part of a  warranty repair that contains more than one part shall not be  the  sole  basis  to charge back the entire repair. A manufacturer shall not deny a  claim submitted under this section based solely on a dealer's incidental  failure to comply  with  a  specific  claim  processing  requirement,  a  clerical  error, or other administrative technicality, provided that the  failure does not call into question the legitimacy of the claim and that  the dealer corrects the claim according to franchisor guidelines.    4. A franchisor shall not charge  a  dealer  back  subsequent  to  the  payment  of  a warranty, sales, advertising or marketing incentive claim  unless a representative of the franchisor  has  met  in  person  at  the  dealership,  or  by telephone, with an officer or employee of the dealer  designated by the dealer and explained in detail the basis for  each  of  the   proposed   charge   backs   and   thereafter  given  the  dealer's  representative a reasonable opportunity at the meeting,  or  during  the  telephone call, to explain the dealer's position relating to each of the  proposed charge backs. In the event the dealer was selected for audit or  review  on the basis that some or all of the dealer's claims were viewed  as  excessive  in  comparison  to  average,  mean  or   aggregate   data  accumulated  by  the franchisor, or in relation to claims submitted by a  group of other franchisees, the franchisor shall, at  or  prior  to  the  meeting  or telephone call with the dealer's representative, provide the  dealer with a written statement containing the basis or methodology upon  which the dealer was selected for audit or review.    5. A franchisor shall not deny or charge back a payment  for  warranty  work claimed by the dealer unless the franchisor satisfies its burden of  proof  that  the  dealer did not make a good faith effort to comply with  the reasonable written procedures of the franchisor or that  the  dealer  did not actually perform the work.    6.  A franchisor shall not deny or charge back a sales, advertising or  marketing incentive payment made  to  a  dealer  unless  the  claim  was  materially  false  or  fraudulent  or  the  dealer  failed to reasonably  substantiate the claim in accordance with the manufacturer's  reasonable  procedures.    7.  After  all  internal dispute resolution processes provided through  the franchisor have been resolved, the franchisor shall give  notice  to  the   dealer  of  the  final  amount  of  a  proposed  warranty,  sales,  advertising or marketing incentive charge back. If the dealer institutes  an action pursuant to this article within thirty days of receipt of such  notice, the proposed charge back shall be stayed, without  bond,  during  the  pendency  of  such  action  and  until  the final judgment has been  rendered in an adjudicatory proceeding or action as provided in  section  four hundred sixty-nine of this article. The franchisor shall not impose  the  chargeback, debit the dealer's account, or otherwise seek to obtain  all or any part of the chargeback  funds  from  the  dealer  during  the  thirty-day  period  in  which  the dealer has the opportunity to file an  action as set forth above."
VAT466,"Vehicle and Traffic      466. Unreasonable  restrictions.  1.  It  shall  be  unlawful  for a  franchisor directly or indirectly to impose unreasonable restrictions on  the franchised motor vehicle dealer relative to transfer, sale, right to  renew  or  termination  of  a  franchise,   discipline,   noncompetition  covenants, site-control (whether by sublease, collateral pledge of lease  or  otherwise),  right of first refusal to purchase, option to purchase,  compliance with subjective standards and assertion of legal or equitable  rights with respect to its franchise or dealership.    2. It shall be deemed an unreasonable restriction  upon  the  sale  or  transfer  of a dealership for a franchisor (i) directly or indirectly to  prevent or attempt to prevent a franchised  motor  vehicle  dealer  from  obtaining  the  fair  value  of  the  franchise or the fair value of the  dealership business as a going concern; or (ii) to refuse to approve the  sale or transfer of a dealership due to the  fact  that  the  franchised  motor  vehicle  dealer  owns,  has an investment in, participates in the  management of or holds a franchise for the sale or  service  of  another  line  make  of  new motor vehicles, or that the franchised motor vehicle  dealer  has  established  another  franchise  in  the  same   dealership  facilities  for  the  sale  or service of another line make of new motor  vehicles prior to the effective date of this  paragraph,  or  the  other  franchise has been approved in writing by the franchisor."
VAT467,"Vehicle and Traffic      467. Dealership facilities assistance upon termination, cancellation  or  nonrenewal. Upon a permitted termination, cancellation or nonrenewal  by the franchisor, unless such termination, cancellation  or  nonrenewal  is  for a reason or reasons set forth in subparagraph three of paragraph  (d) of subdivision two of  section  four  hundred  sixty-three  of  this  article,  the  franchisor  shall assume the obligations for any lease of  the dealership facilities or arrange for a new lease of  the  dealership  facilities  or  pay the dealer the lease payments for one year, whatever  is less, or negotiate a lease termination for the dealership  facilities  at  the  franchisor's  expense.  If  the  facilities  are  owned  by the  franchised motor vehicle dealer, the franchisor shall pay such dealer  a  sum equivalent to the reasonable rental value of the dealership facility  for  one  year,  provided  the  franchised  motor  vehicle  dealer shall  mitigate damages in the case of an owned facility."
VAT468,"Vehicle and Traffic      468. Preservation of consumer protection statutes. Nothing contained  herein  shall in any way be construed or interpreted to modify, limit or  affect the full powers and duties heretofore  or  hereafter  granted  to  consumer protection agencies created by statute or regulation enacted by  state,  city, county or local municipalities and the rights of consumers  to make complaints thereto, it being  the  intent  of  this  article  to  provide  for  the  settlement and/or determination of disputes under the  franchised  motor  vehicle  dealer  act  as  between   franchisors   and  franchised motor vehicle dealers as defined herein."
VAT469,"Vehicle and Traffic      469. Private actions. 1. A franchised motor vehicle dealer who is or  may  be  aggrieved  by  a violation of this article shall be entitled to  request an  adjudicatory  proceeding,  as  prescribed  in  section  four  hundred  seventy-one-a of this article, or in lieu thereof, sue for, and  have, injunctive relief and damages in any court  of  the  state  having  jurisdiction   over   the  parties.  In  any  such  judicial  action  or  proceeding, the court may award necessary costs and disbursements plus a  reasonable attorney's fee to any party.    2. Whenever a franchise provides for the use of arbitration to resolve  a controversy arising out of or relating to such  contract,  arbitration  may  be  used  to settle such controversy only if after such controversy  arises all parties  to  such  controversy  consent  in  writing  to  use  arbitration to settle such controversy."

In  addition,  the commissioner also shall require that an applicant for  an identification card or renewal thereof  provide  his  or  her  social  security  number.

The  licensing  jurisdiction  requires  that  a  record  of  each  interjurisdictional trip be entered prior to the  commencement  of  such  trip in a log maintained and kept readily accessible in the vehicle in a  form and manner prescribed by the licensing jurisdiction and produced at  the  request  of  any police officer or peace officer acting pursuant to  his or her special duties or other enforcement personnel  authorized  by  such  jurisdiction.  Such  record  shall be kept for a period of no less  than one year after such trip. Failure to produce such a log  maintained  in the manner prescribed by such jurisdiction when requested by a police  officer  or other enforcement personnel shall be presumptive evidence of  illegal interjurisdictional operation.    j. The licensing jurisdiction requires that the owner  of  each  motor  vehicle licensed as a pre-arranged for-hire vehicle hold a valid vehicle  registration  for  such  vehicle  issued  by  the department for which a  registration fee has been paid pursuant to  schedule  C  of  subdivision  seven  of  section  four hundred one of this title, or, in the case of a  non-resident of this state, a vehicle registration issued by  the  state  of residence.    k.  No  owner of a vehicle licensed as a pre-arranged for-hire vehicle  by a licensing jurisdiction meeting the standards  and  requirements  of  this  subdivision  and  subdivisions four and six of this section or any  person or business engaged in the for-hire transportation of  passengers  by motor vehicle that is affiliated with such licensee shall do business  within   any   jurisdiction   in   which  it  seeks  to  operate  on  an  interjurisdictional basis. ""Do business"" shall mean having  a  place  of  business  or  telephone number in such jurisdiction relating to for-hire  transportation of passengers by motor vehicle.    4.   Standards  for  drivers  of  pre-arranged  for-hire  vehicles.  A  licensing jurisdiction shall be deemed to comply with the provisions  of  this subdivision if it requires the following as conditions of licensure  of pre-arranged for-hire vehicle drivers:    a.  The  pre-arranged for-hire vehicle driver is fingerprinted and his  or her criminal history obtained from the department of criminal justice  services.    b. The licensing jurisdiction adopts criteria  pursuant  to  which  an  applicant  for  a  new or renewal pre-arranged for-hire vehicle driver's  license shall be denied, and a pre-arranged  for-hire  vehicle  driver's  license  shall be suspended or revoked, upon conviction of the applicant  or licensee for a serious criminal offense, subject to applicable  laws,  including,  but not limited to, article twenty-three-A of the correction  law.    c.  The  licensing  jurisdiction  provides  by  regulation   for   the  continuing  review  of the driving record of every pre-arranged for-hire  vehicle driver licensed by such jurisdiction, as reflected in the number  and type of convictions accumulated on the driver's  license  issued  to  such  driver. Such regulation shall provide for the mandatory suspension  for a thirty-day period of  a  pre-arranged  for-hire  vehicle  driver's  license  upon  the  accumulation  of  a  specified  number  and  type of  conviction on such person's  driver's  license  within  a  fifteen-month  period,  and the mandatory revocation of a pre-arranged for-hire vehicle  driver's license upon  the  accumulation  of  an  additional  number  of  convictions  of  a  specified  number and type on such person's driver's  license within a fifteen-month period.    d. The  licensing  jurisdiction  requires  that  an  applicant  for  a  pre-arranged  for-hire  vehicle driver's license submit to drug testing,  and that licensed pre-arranged for-hire vehicle drivers be  required  to  submit  to  additional drug testing upon each application for renewal of  such  person's  pre-arranged  for-hire  vehicle  driver's  license,  and  additional  drug  testing  such  that each licensee shall submit to such  drug testing no less often than once each year; and that  any  applicant  who  tests  positive for drugs or intoxicating liquors shall be denied a  pre-arranged for-hire vehicle driver's  license,  and  the  pre-arranged  for-hire vehicle driver's license of any licensee who tests positive for  drugs  or  intoxicating  liquors  shall  be  revoked after notice and an  opportunity to be heard. Such drug  test  shall  be  administered  by  a  person  or  entity  holding the requisite permit from the New York state  department of health. Individual test results and  any  related  medical  information  about  such  applicant  or  licensee shall be confidential,  shall not be disclosed except to the applicant or licensee or his or her  representative, and shall not be entered or received as evidence at  any  civil,  criminal  or  administrative  trial, hearing or proceeding other  than an administrative trial, hearing or proceeding for  the  denial  or  revocation  of the pre-arranged for-hire vehicle driver's license as set  forth in this paragraph. No person, other than an applicant or  licensee  who  is  the subject of such records to whom such records are disclosed,  may redisclose such records.    e. The licensing jurisdiction requires that every individual  applying  for  a  pre-arranged for-hire vehicle driver's license must submit proof  of completion of a state-approved defensive driving course no more  than  six  months prior to the date of application. The licensing jurisdiction  shall further  require  that  any  individual  renewing  a  pre-arranged  for-hire  vehicle  driver's license must submit proof of completion of a  state-approved defensive driving course no more than three  years  prior  to the date of the renewal application.    5.  On-street  inspections. The enforcement authorities of a licensing  jurisdiction  meeting  the  standards  and  requirements  set  forth  in  subdivisions  three,  four and six of this section may conduct on-street  inspections of all vehicles operating as pre-arranged for-hire  vehicles  within  such  jurisdiction. A pre-arranged for-hire vehicle owner may be  ordered by such licensing jurisdiction to repair or replace such vehicle  where it appears that it no longer meets the  reasonable  standards  for  safe  operation  prescribed  by  regulations  of such jurisdiction. Upon  failure of the pre-arranged for-hire vehicle owner to comply  with  such  an  order within ten days after service thereof, the recognition of such  owner's pre-arranged for-hire vehicle license shall be suspended by  the  licensing  jurisdiction.  Provided, however, that this subdivision shall  not  impair  such  authority  to  conduct   on-street   inspections   of  pre-arranged for-hire vehicles as may otherwise exist.    6.  Notification.  A  licensing jurisdiction meeting the standards and  requirements set forth in this subdivision and  subdivisions  three  and  four  of this section shall, upon both the issuance and disposition of a  summons issued in such jurisdiction to a pre-arranged  for-hire  vehicle  licensed in another jurisdiction, notify such other jurisdiction of such  issuance and disposition."

The  purpose  of  the  component  is  to educate prospective licensees on the  effects that the development and expression of ""Road Rage"",  as  defined  by  the  commissioner,  have  on  a  person's ability to operate a motor  vehicle. The commissioner shall establish a  curriculum  for  the  ""Road  Rage""  component  which shall include but not be limited to: instruction  describing the hazards of driving and exiting the  vehicle  while  under  the  influence  of  ""Road  Rage"";  the penalties for ""Road Rage""-related  motor vehicle or other violations including sanctions set forth  in  the  penal  law  that  apply  to  homicides  and  assaults arising out of the  operation of a motor vehicle  while  expressing  ""Road  Rage"",  and  any  sanctions set forth in law relating to driving while under the influence  of ""Road Rage""; and the medical, biological and physiological effects of  the  development  and expression of ""Road Rage"", and their impact on the  operation of a motor vehicle.  The  commissioner  is  charged  with  the  responsibility  for  defining  the  term  ""Road  Rage"",  as used in this  paragraph, in  consultation  with  law  enforcement  personnel,  medical  professionals,  representatives  of  the  court  system,  highway safety  officials, and any  other  group  that  the  commissioner  believes  can  contribute to a comprehensive statement of the issue.    (c-2)  ""Work  Zone  Safety""  awareness component. (i) The commissioner  shall provide in the pre-licensing course, set forth in paragraph (b) of  this subdivision, a mandatory component in ""Work Zone Safety""  awareness  education  as  a prerequisite for obtaining a license to operate a motor  vehicle.  The  purpose  of  the  component  is  to  educate  prospective  licensees on the potential dangers to construction workers, construction  equipment  operators  and  operators of motor vehicles in a highway work  zone. For the purposes of this paragraph, the  term  ""work  zone""  shall  include  ""work  area""  as  defined  by section one hundred sixty of this  chapter, and ""restricted  highway""  as  authorized  in  section  sixteen  hundred twenty-five of this chapter.    (ii)  The commissioner shall establish a curriculum for the ""Work Zone  Safety"" component which shall include but not be limited to: instruction  describing the potential hazards of driving through a work zone, whether  or  not  work,  maintenance  or  other  related  construction  is  being  undertaken therein, and information on the provisions of law relating to  driving  within  a  work  zone  and  sanctions  for  violations  of such  provisions, including speeding in a work zone.    (iii) In developing such curriculum, the  commissioner  shall  consult  with the commissioner of transportation, the superintendent of the state  police,   representatives   of   the   highway   construction  industry,  representatives  of  highway  construction   workers,   highway   safety  officials,  and  any  other  group  that  the  commissioner believes can  contribute to a comprehensive presentation of the issue.    (d) The  commissioner  shall  make  available  for  distribution  upon  registration  at  each  location  where the pre-licensing course will be  given, instructional handbooks  outlining  the  content  of  the  entire  curriculum   of  the  pre-licensing  course  including  the  information  required to be included in the course pursuant to paragraphs (c),  (c-1)  and  (c-2)  of this subdivision. The commissioner shall also provide for  the additional training of the instructors necessary for  the  competent  instruction  of the alcohol and drug education and ""Road Rage"" awareness  and ""Work Zone Safety"" awareness subject matters  of  the  pre-licensing  course.    (e)  The  commissioner  shall  make  available to each applicant for a  commercial  driver's  license  instructional  handbooks  outlining   the  requirements  necessary  to  qualify  for such license, and containing a  discussion of the offenses which will result  in  disqualification  from  operating  a commercial motor vehicle as defined in section five hundred  one-a of this chapter. Such handbooks shall be available in both English  and Spanish language versions.    (f) The commissioner shall promulgate such rules  and  regulations  as  are necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.    (g) The commissioner may, in his discretion, waive the requirement for  passage of a test with respect to the laws relating to traffic, the laws  relating  to driving while ability is impaired and while intoxicated and  the ability to read and comprehend traffic signs and  symbols,  and  the  requirement  for  completion of the course set forth in paragraph (a) of  this subdivision for applicants who hold a valid or  renewable  driver's  license issued by another jurisdiction or the United States government.    (h) Course completion certificate fee. The fee for a course completion  certificate  provided by the department to an entity that is approved by  the commissioner to offer the pre-licensing  course,  required  by  this  subdivision,  for  issuance  by  such  entity  to  students  upon  their  completion of such pre-licensing course shall be one  dollar.  Such  fee  shall  be  paid  by such entity and shall not be charged to a person who  takes the course in any manner.    5.  Issuance  of  license.  (a)  Upon  successful  completion  of  the  requirements  set  forth  in  subdivision four of this section, and upon  payment of the fee prescribed by law, the commissioner  shall  issue  an  appropriate  license  to the applicant, except that the commissioner may  refuse to issue such license    (i) if the applicant is the holder of a currently valid  or  renewable  license  to  drive issued by another state or foreign country unless the  applicant surrenders such license, or    (ii) if such issuance would be inconsistent  with  the  provisions  of  section five hundred sixteen of this chapter.    (b)  The  commissioner  shall,  with  respect  to  the  issuance  of a  hazardous materials endorsement, comply with  the  requirements  imposed  upon  states pursuant to sections 383.141 and 1572.13 of title 49 of the  code of federal regulations.    (c) The commissioner shall not issue a commercial driver's license  to  a  person  while  such  person would be subject to disqualification from  operating a commercial motor vehicle for any  cause  set  forth  in  the  commercial  motor  vehicle  safety  act  of nineteen hundred eighty-six,  public law 99-570, title XII and regulations promulgated thereunder.  In  addition,  the  commissioner shall suspend a commercial driver's license  for the period of time in which such driver is determined to  constitute  an imminent hazard and is disqualified pursuant to 49 C.F.R 383.52.    6.  Renewal  of  license. (a) A license issued pursuant to subdivision  five of this section shall be valid until the expiration date  contained  thereon,  unless  such  license is suspended, revoked or cancelled. Such  license may be renewed by submission of an application for renewal,  the  fee prescribed by law, proofs of prior licensing, fitness and acceptable  vision  prescribed  by the commissioner, the applicant's social security  number, and if required  by  the  commissioner  a  photo  image  of  the  applicant  in such numbers and form as the commissioner shall prescribe.  In addition,  an  applicant  for  renewal  of  a  license  containing  a  hazardous  material endorsement shall pass an examination to retain such  endorsement. The commissioner shall, with respect to the  renewal  of  a  hazardous  materials  endorsement,  comply with the requirements imposed  upon states by sections 383.141 and 1572.13 of title 49 of the  code  of  federal  regulations.  A  renewal of such license shall be issued by the  commissioner upon approval of such  application,  except  that  no  such  license  shall  be issued if its issuance would be inconsistent with the  provisions of section five hundred sixteen of  this  title,  and  except  that  the commissioner may refuse to renew such license if the applicant  is the holder of a currently valid or renewable license to drive  issued  by another state or foreign country unless the applicant surrenders such  license.    (b)  Time  for  renewal.  A  renewal  license may only be issued if an  application for such license is filed within two years from the date  of  expiration  of the prior license. Such application may be filed prior to  the expiration of the license being renewed for  a  period  of  time  as  provided by regulation of the commissioner.    7. Compliance with selective service act required. (a) All persons who  are at least eighteen years of age but less than twenty-six years of age  who  apply to the commissioner for a learner's permit, driver's license,  renewal of license, or non-driver's identification card,  shall  either:  (i)  be  in  compliance  with the requirements of the military selective  service act as provided for pursuant to 50 U.S.C.

(b)  The  commissioner  shall  forward  in  an  electronic  format the  necessary  personal  information  required  for  registration  of   such  individuals  specified  in  paragraph  (a)  of this subdivision with the  selective  service  system.  Such  individual's   application   to   the  commissioner  for  a  learner's  permit,  driver's  license,  renewal of  license or non-drivers' identification card shall serve as an indication  that the applicant has already registered with  the  military  selective  service  act  or that such individual is authorizing the commissioner to  forward to the selective service system the  necessary  information  for  such  selective service registration. The commissioner shall notify such  applicants on the application form that any application for a  learner's  permit,   driver's   license,   renewal   of   license  or  non-driver's  identification card shall serve as consent to  be  registered  with  the  selective service system, if so required by federal law."

When  the  basis for the revocation is a finding of driving after having  consumed alcohol pursuant to the provisions of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two-a  of  this  chapter,  the fee to be paid to the commissioner  shall be one hundred dollars. Such fee is not refundable and  shall  not  be  returned  to the applicant regardless of the action the commissioner  may take on such person's application for reinstatement of such  driving  license.  Such  fee  shall  be  in  addition to any other fees presently  levied but shall not apply to an applicant whose  driver's  license  was  revoked  for  failure to pass a reexamination or to an applicant who has  been issued a conditional or restricted use license under the provisions  of article twenty-one-A or thirty-one of this chapter.    (i) A non-resident whose driving privileges have been revoked pursuant  to sections five hundred ten, eleven  hundred  ninety-three  and  eleven  hundred   ninety-four  of  this  chapter  shall,  upon  application  for  reinstatement of such driving privileges, pay  to  the  commissioner  of  motor  vehicles a fee of twenty-five dollars.

(j) Whenever a license issued pursuant to this article, or a privilege  of operating a motor vehicle or of obtaining such a  license,  has  been  suspended, such suspension shall remain in effect until a termination of  a suspension fee of fifty dollars is paid to the commissioner; provided,  however, when the basis for the suspension is a finding of driving after  having  consumed  alcohol  pursuant  to the provisions of section eleven  hundred ninety-two-a of  this  chapter,  the  fee  to  be  paid  to  the  commissioner  shall  be  one  hundred  dollars.  The  provisions of this  paragraph shall not apply to a temporary suspension pending  a  hearing,  prosecution  or  investigation, nor to an indefinite suspension which is  issued because of the failure of the person suspended to perform an act,  which suspension will be terminated by the performance of the act.    (j-1) (i) When a  license  issued  pursuant  to  this  article,  or  a  privilege  of  operating a motor vehicle or of obtaining such a license,  has been suspended based upon a failure to answer an  appearance  ticket  or  a  summons or failure to pay a fine, penalty or mandatory surcharge,  pursuant  to  subdivision  three  of  section  two  hundred  twenty-six,  subdivision four of section two hundred twenty-seven, subdivision four-a  of  section  five  hundred ten or subdivision five-a of section eighteen  hundred nine of this chapter, such suspension  shall  remain  in  effect  until  a  termination  of a suspension fee of seventy dollars is paid to  the court or tribunal that initiated the suspension of such  license  or  privilege.  In  no  event  may  the  aggregate of the fees imposed by an  individual court pursuant to this paragraph for the termination  of  all  suspensions  that  may  be terminated as a result of a person's answers,  appearances  or  payments  made  in  such  cases  pending  before   such  individual  court  exceed four hundred dollars. For the purposes of this  paragraph,  the  various  locations  of  the   administrative   tribunal  established  under  article two-A of this chapter shall be considered an  individual court.    (ii)  Any  such fee collected by any court, judge, magistrate or other  officer specified in subdivision  one  of  section  thirty-nine  of  the  judiciary law, establishing a unified court budget, shall be paid to the  state  commissioner  of taxation and finance on a monthly basis no later  than ten days after  the  last  day  of  each  month.  All  such  monies  collected  under  this  subdivision  shall  be deposited to the indigent  legal services fund established by section ninety-eight-b of  the  state  finance law.

(b) The commissioner may by regulation  provide  that  every  driver's  license  contain  the  photo image of the licensee. The learner's permit  may  also  contain  the  photo  image  of  the  permittee  pursuant   to  regulations established by the commissioner.    2.

If the commissioner is satisfied that the applicant is entitled  to a duplicate of such item, he shall issue a  duplicate  of  the  lost,  mutilated  or  destroyed  item.  Any mutilated item shall be surrendered  before a duplicate is issued. If a duplicate license or permit is issued  because of a lost license or permit, and such lost license or permit  is  later  recovered  by  the  licensee or permit holder, he shall surrender  such recovered item to the commissioner for cancellation within ten days  after recovery of such item.    2. Change of class of license or addition of  class  to  license.  Any  licensee  holding a license of one class who desires to obtain a license  of another class or to add a different class or endorsement to a license  may file an application with the commissioner together with the fee  for  an  amended  license for the purpose of having such license amended. The  commissioner may require such applicant to take any tests  required  for  the  issuance  of  a  license  in  the  desired class.

If  the  commissioner  has  reasonable grounds to believe that a person  holding  a  license  issued  pursuant  to this article is not qualified to drive a motor vehicle, the  commissioner may require such person to  submit  to  an  examination  to  determine his qualifications.    2.  The commissioner may require every person holding a license issued  pursuant to this article to submit to such an examination  as  shall  be  determined  by him to be appropriate if such person has been involved in  three accidents while driving a motor vehicle  or  motorcycle  within  a  period  of  eighteen  months,  if  such  accidents  were  required to be  reported by section six hundred five of this chapter.    3. If the licensee satisfactorily  passes  any  such  examination,  he  shall  be  so informed and his license shall continue to be valid. If he  fails to pass, the commissioner shall take such reasonable action as may  be required.  Such action may consist of imposing  restrictions  on  the  use  of  the  license  of  such person, in suspending such license for a  definite or indefinite period, or in revoking such license. If any  such  person  fails  after  reasonable  notice  or  refuses  to  submit  to an  examination, the commissioner may revoke his license or suspend  it  for  an indefinite period solely because of such failure or refusal.    4.  Any  person  holding a license issued pursuant to this chapter who  suffers permanent loss of use of one or both hands or arms or of one  or  both  feet or legs, or one eye shall, before operating any motor vehicle  or motorcycle make report thereof to the commissioner,  who  shall  take  such  reasonable  action  as  may be proper under the provisions of this  section.    5.

Failure by a licensee to exhibit a  license valid for operation under this chapter to any magistrate,  motor  vehicle  license  examiner,  motor  vehicle investigator, peace officer,  acting pursuant to his  special  duties,  or  police  officer  shall  be  presumptive evidence that he is not duly licensed.    4.  Entry  into  military  service.  If any person who enters military  service shall fail to give timely notification in writing of such  entry  to  the commissioner, the commissioner may, in his discretion, refuse to  renew such person's driver's license, if such license is  not  otherwise  renewable under the provisions of this article.    5.

Such notification shall be provided  in accordance with regulations established by the commissioner and shall  include any information the  motor  carrier  has  relative  to  the  bus  driver's  disqualification, including any information regarding criminal  charges pending against the driver for violations which would disqualify  the driver if a conviction resulted.    (5) Each motor  carrier  shall  furnish  the  department,  by  October  fifteenth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-five,  a  list  of all bus drivers  employed  on  September  fourteenth,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-five  in  accordance with regulations established by the commissioner.

The  provisions  of this section shall not be construed to prevent any person  who has the authority to  suspend  or  revoke  a  license  to  drive  or  privilege  of  operating  pursuant  to  section five hundred ten of this  chapter from exercising any such authority based upon a  conviction  for  which  suspension  or revocation of a commercial driver's license by the  commissioner is mandated.    8.  Disqualifications  based  upon  record  review.  (a)   Where   the  commissioner  conducts a state record review pursuant to section 384.206  of title 49 of the code of federal regulations and he or she  determines  that:  (i)  a  person  applying  for  a  commercial driver's license was  convicted outside of this state of  an  offense  set  forth  in  section  383.51  of  title  49 of the code of federal regulations while holding a  commercial driver's license issued by another state; and (ii) such other  state failed to impose the commercial driver's license disqualification,  suspension or revocation set forth in section 383.51 of title 49 of  the  code  of  federal  regulations  for  such offense, then the commissioner  shall immediately suspend such person's commercial driver's  license  or  privilege  of  operating  a commercial motor vehicle. Provided, however,  that where such licenses would have been subject to  revocation  upon  a  conviction  for  such  conduct  had  it  occurred  in  this  state,  the  commissioner shall revoke such license. Such  suspension  or  revocation  shall  be  for  the applicable period of time set forth for a conviction  for such offense in such section 383.51 as it existed on the date of the  violation.    (b) Any suspension or revocation  of  a  commercial  driver's  license  issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall be applicable  only to that portion of the holder's driver's license or privilege which  permits the operation of commercial motor vehicles, and the commissioner  shall  immediately  issue  a  license,  other than a commercial driver's  license, to such person provided that such person is otherwise  eligible  to  receive  such license and further provided that issuing a license to  such person does not create a substantial traffic safety hazard."

The  commissioner  shall,  upon  a  holder's status becoming ""not-certified"",  notify the holder of such commercial driver's  license  by  first  class  mail to the address of such person on file with the department or at the  current  address  provided by the United States postal service of his or  her ""not-certified"" medical certification status and  that  his  or  her  commercial  driver's  license  will  be  downgraded  to a non-commercial  driver's license unless he or she submits a current medical  certificate  and/or medical variance in accordance with Part 383.71(h) of title 49 of  the code of federal regulations or changes his or her self-certification  to  driving  only  in excepted or intrastate commerce in accordance with  Part 383.71(b)(ii)(B), (C) or (D) of title 49 of  the  code  of  federal  regulations."

Any  person with a security interest in such vehicle who receives  notice  of  the  institution  of  the forfeiture action shall assert a claim for the  satisfaction of such person's  security  interest  in  such  vehicle  by  intervening  in the forfeiture action in accordance with subdivision (a)  of section one thousand twelve of the civil practice law and rules.   If  the  action  relates  to  a vehicle in which a person holding a security  interest has intervened pursuant to this subdivision, the  burden  shall  be  upon  the  designated  official  to  prove  by  clear and convincing  evidence that such intervenor knew that such vehicle  was  or  would  be  used for the commission of a violation of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision three of section five hundred eleven of the vehicle  and traffic law and either (a) knowingly and unlawfully benefitted  from  such conduct or (b) voluntarily agreed to the use of the vehicle for the  commission  of  such  violation by consent freely given. For purposes of  this subdivision, such intervenor  knowingly  and  unlawfully  benefited  from the commission of such violation when he or she derived in exchange  for permitting the use of such vehicle by a person or persons committing  such  specified violation a substantial benefit that would otherwise not  have accrued as a result of the lawful use of  such  vehicle.  ""Benefit""  means  benefit  as  defined in subdivision seventeen of section 10.00 of  the penal law.    9. No motor vehicle shall be  forfeited  under  this  section  to  the  extent  of  the interest of a person who claims an interest in the motor  vehicle, where such person pleads and proves that:    (a) The use of such motor vehicle for the conduct that was  the  basis  for  a seizure occurred without the knowledge of such person, or if such  person had knowledge of such use, without the consent  of  such  person,  and that such person did not knowingly obtain such interest in the motor  vehicle in order to avoid the forfeiture of such vehicle; or    (b)  The  conduct that was the basis for such seizure was committed by  any person other than such person claiming  an  interest  in  the  motor  vehicle,  while such motor vehicle was unlawfully in the possession of a  person who acquired possession thereof in violation of the criminal laws  of the United States or any state.    10. The court in which a forfeiture action is pending may dismiss said  action in the interests of justice  upon  its  own  motion  or  upon  an  application as provided for herein.    (a)  At  any  time  during  the  pendency  of a forfeiture action, the  designated official who instituted the action, or a defendant may  apply  for  an  order  dismissing  the complaint and terminating the forfeiture  action in the interest of justice.    (b) Such application for the relief provided in paragraph (a) of  this  subdivision  must be made in writing and upon notice to all parties. The  court may, in its discretion, direct that notice be given to  any  other  person having an interest in the property.    (c)  An  application  for  the relief provided for in paragraph (a) of  this subdivision must be brought exclusively in the  superior  court  in  which the forfeiture action is pending.    (d)  The  court may grant the relief provided in paragraph (a) of this  subdivision if it finds that such relief is warranted by  the  existence  of  some  compelling factor, consideration or circumstance demonstrating  that forfeiture of the property or any part thereof, would not serve the  ends of justice. Among the factors, considerations and circumstances the  court may consider, among others, are:    (i) the seriousness and  circumstances  of  the  crime  to  which  the  property  is  connected relative to the impact of forfeiture of property  upon the person who committed the crime; or    (ii) the adverse impact of a  forfeiture  of  property  upon  innocent  persons.    (e)  The  court must issue a written decision stating the basis for an  order issued pursuant to this subdivision.    11. The district attorney,  police  department  or  superintendent  of  state  police  having  custody  of  the seized motor vehicle, after such  judicial determination of forfeiture, shall, by a public  notice  of  at  least twenty days, sell such forfeited motor vehicle at public sale. The  net  proceeds  of  any such sale, after deduction of the lawful expenses  incurred, shall be paid into the general fund of the county wherein  the  seizure  was  made, provided, however, that the net proceeds of the sale  of a motor vehicle seized in the cities of New York, Yonkers,  Rochester  and  Buffalo  shall  be  paid  into the respective general funds of such  cities, and provided further that the net proceeds  of  the  sale  of  a  motor  vehicle  seized  by the state police shall be paid into the state  police seized assets account.    12. In any action commenced pursuant to this section, where the  court  awards  a  sum  of  money to one or more persons in satisfaction of such  person's or persons'  interest  or  interests  in  the  forfeited  motor  vehicle,  the total amount awarded to satisfy such interest or interests  shall not exceed the amount of the net  proceeds  of  the  sale  of  the  forfeited motor vehicle, after deduction of the lawful expenses incurred  by  the county, cities of New York, Yonkers, Rochester or Buffalo or the  state, as applicable, and storage of the motor vehicle between the  time  of seizure and the date of sale.    13.  At  any  time  within  two  years  after  the seizure, any person  claiming an interest  in  a  motor  vehicle  which  has  been  forfeited  pursuant  to this section who was not sent notice of the commencement of  the forfeiture action pursuant to subdivision seven of this section,  or  who  did  not  otherwise receive actual notice of the forfeiture action,  may assert in an action commenced before  the  justice  of  the  supreme  court  before  whom  the  forfeiture action was held such claim as could  have been asserted in the forfeiture action pursuant  to  this  section.  The  court may grant the relief sought upon such terms and conditions as  it deems reasonable and just if the person claiming an interest  in  the  motor  vehicle  establishes  that  he  or she was not sent notice of the  commencement of the forfeiture action and was without  actual  knowledge  of  the  forfeiture  action,  and  establishes either of the affirmative  defenses set forth in subdivision nine of this section.    14.  No  action  under  this  section  for  wrongful  seizure shall be  instituted unless such action is commenced within two  years  after  the  time when the motor vehicle was seized."

Provided, however, that proof provided to  the commissioner by a registrant in the form of a certification provided  to such registrant pursuant to this paragraph shall have the same effect  as proof provided to the commissioner by such  court  or  administrative  tribunal.     5. Upon the conviction of any person under eighteen years of age who  resides  within the household of his parent or guardian, the trial court  or clerk shall forthwith transmit written notice of such  conviction  to  the  parent  or  guardian  of such minor person; provided, however, that  transmittal of such notice of conviction shall not be  required  in  any  case  in  which  notice of arraignment of such person upon the charge or  charges  of  which  convicted  is  required  by,  and  shall  have  been  previously  transmitted  as  provided  in,  subdivision  two  of section  eighteen hundred seven of this chapter.    6.

(2) Violation of such a law or ordinance is evidence that the violator  engages in conduct which is likely to endanger the safety of persons and  property.    (3)  The continuance in force of a license to drive is predicated upon  compliance with laws and ordinances relating to the operation  of  motor  vehicles, in whichever jurisdiction the vehicle is operated.    (b) It is the policy of each of the party states to:    (1)  Promote  compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative  rules and regulations relating to the operation  of  motor  vehicles  by  their  operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive  motor vehicles.    (2)  Make  the  reciprocal  recognition  of  licenses  to  drive   and  eligibility  therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall  compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances and administrative  rules  and  regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance  of any license  by  reason  of  which  the  licensee  is  authorized  or  permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states.

ARTICLE III                            REPORTS OF CONVICTION    The licensing authority of a party state shall report each  conviction  of  a  person from another party state occurring within its jurisdiction  to the licensing authority of the  home  state  of  the  licensee.  Such  report  shall  clearly  identify  the  person  convicted;  describe  the  violation specifying the section  of  the  statute,  code  or  ordinance  violated; identify the court in which action was taken; indicate whether  a  plea  of  guilty  or  not guilty was entered, or the conviction was a  result of the forfeiture of bail, bond  or  other  security;  and  shall  include any special findings made in connection therewith.                                 ARTICLE IV                            EFFECT OF CONVICTION    (a)  The  licensing  authority  in the home state, for the purposes of  suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to operate  a  motor  vehicle, shall give the same effect to the conduct reported, pursuant to  article III of this compact, as it would if such conduct had occurred in  the home state, in the case of convictions for:    (1) Manslaughter or negligent homicide resulting from the operation of  a motor vehicle;    (2)  Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating  liquor or a narcotic drug, or under the influence of any other drug to a  degree which renders the driver incapable  of  safely  driving  a  motor  vehicle;    (3) Any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used;    (4)  Failure  to  stop  and render aid in the event of a motor vehicle  accident resulting in the death or personal injury of another.    (b) If the laws of a party  state  do  not  provide  for  offenses  or  violations  denominated  or described in precisely the words employed in  subdivision (a) of this article, such party  state  shall  construe  the  denominations  and  descriptions  appearing in subdivision (a) hereof as  being applicable to and identifying those offenses or  violations  of  a  substantially  similar  nature  and  the  laws of such party state shall  contain such provisions as may be necessary to ensure  that  full  force  and effect is given to this article.

The  licensing authority in the state where application  is  made  shall  not  issue a license to drive to the applicant if:    (1)  The  applicant  has  held  such  a license, but the same has been  suspended by reason, in whole or in part, of a  violation  and  if  such  suspension period has not terminated.    (2)  The  applicant  has  held  such  a license, but the same has been  revoked by reason, in whole or in part,  of  a  violation  and  if  such  revocation  has  not terminated, except that after the expiration of one  year from the date  the  license  was  revoked,  such  person  may  make  application  for  a  new  license  if  permitted  by  law. The licensing  authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant if,  after  investigation,  the  licensing  authority determines that it will not be  safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on  the public highways.    (3) The applicant is the holder  of  a  license  to  drive  issued  by  another  party  state  and  currently  in  force  unless  the  applicant  surrenders such license.                                 ARTICLE VI                         APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS    Except as expressly required by provisions of  this  compact,  nothing  contained  herein  shall  be  construed to affect the right of any party  state to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses  to  drive  to  any  person  or  circumstance,  nor  to invalidate or prevent any driver  license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state  and a non-party state.

(b)  The  administrator  of  each  party  state  shall  furnish to the  administrator of each other party state  any  information  or  documents  reasonably necessary to facilitate the administration of this compact.                                ARTICLE VIII                       ENTRY INTO FORCE AND WITHDRAWAL    (a) This compact shall enter into force and become effective as to any  state when it has enacted the same into law.    (b)  Any  party  state  may  withdraw  from this compact by enacting a  statute repealing the same, but no such  withdrawal  shall  take  effect  until  six  months after the executive head of the withdrawing state has  given notice of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party  states. No withdrawal shall affect the validity or applicability by  the  licensing  authorities  of  states remaining party to the compact of any  report of conviction occurring prior to the withdrawal.                                 ARTICLE IX                        CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY    This compact shall be liberally construed  so  as  to  effectuate  the  purposes  thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and  if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared  to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of  the  United  States or the applicability thereof of any government, agency, person or  circumstance  is  held  invalid,  the  validity of the remainder of this  compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency,  person  or  circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

(3) As used in the compact, with reference to  this  state,  the  term  ""executive head"" shall mean the governor.    (4)  The  conduct  to  which effect shall be given pursuant to article  four-a of the compact shall be conduct which, if it had occurred in this  state, would have constituted an offense or violation within the meaning  of subparagraphs (i) and (iii) of  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  two,  paragraph  (f)  of  subdivision  three  of  section five hundred ten and  subparagraph seven of paragraph (b) of subdivision two of section eleven  hundred ninety-three of the vehicle and traffic law.

Any such compact or  agreement  shall  specify  the  offenses  subject  to  the  compact   or  agreement,  and  shall include a determination of comparable offenses in  each state if any such offenses are of a  substantially  similar  nature  but are not denominated or described in precisely the same words in each  party state.

VAT520,"Vehicle and Traffic      520. Statement   of   findings   and  declaration  of  purpose.  The  ever-increasing  number  of  accidents,  personal  injuries  and  deaths  resulting  from  alcohol or drug-related traffic offenses is a matter of  great  concern  to  the  legislature.  The  diminished   perception   of  intoxicated and impaired operators of motor vehicles presents a constant  and  intolerable  threat  to the lives and well-being of the citizens of  the  state.  Efforts  aimed  at  alleviating  this  threat  have  proven  inadequate.  The  public interest in the cause of highway safety will be  well  served  by  the  implementation  of   a   permanent   program   of  rehabilitation  for those operators convicted of alcohol or drug-related  traffic  offenses  and  certain  operators  who  have  been  adjudicated  youthful  offenders  for  alcohol  or drug-related traffic offenses. The  commissioner of motor vehicles should have the  authority  to  offer  to  such  operators  an opportunity for rehabilitation, thereby reducing the  threat aimed at themselves and the people of the state."
VAT523,"Vehicle and Traffic      523. Reports.  The  commissioner shall report to the governor and to  the legislature annually with respect to the status of the  alcohol  and  drug  rehabilitation program, including therein, among other things, the  scope and results of procedures for screening and  referral  of  program  participants  exhibiting  an  early stage, of alcoholism or chronic life  problem with alcohol, providing that such report shall not  contain  the  name of or otherwise identify participants in such program."
VAT523-A,"Vehicle and Traffic      523-a. Driver improvement clinic programs. In addition to the driver  rehabilitation  program  authorized by section eleven hundred ninety-six  of  this  chapter,  the  commissioner  may  establish,  by   regulation,  guidelines  for alcohol and highway safety programs. The purpose of such  programs should be to inform participants of the effects of  alcohol  on  driving,  to  discuss  problem  drinking  and  its  effects,  to provide  assistance to individuals with referral to alcoholism treatment agencies  and to provide instruction with respect to proper driving techniques and  driver attitude. The commissioner shall establish criteria for requiring  attendance at such clinics, and may, pending attendance at such  clinic,  suspend  the  driver's  license  or privilege of any person who fails to  attend such clinic as required by such regulations.  Such  criteria  may  provide for the required attendance at such clinic of any person who, as  a  result  of the conviction for a moving traffic violation, is referred  by the trial court for such attendance. The commissioner shall establish  a fee to be paid by any person who attends any such  program.  Such  fee  shall  be  used to defray the ongoing expenses of the program. Where the  commissioner has approved any driver improvement  program  conducted  by  local  authorities,  any such fee shall be paid to the agency conducting  such program."
VAT523-B,"Vehicle and Traffic      523-b. Experimental  driver  safety  programs.  The commissioner may  study the feasibility of programs to improve driver behavior,  attitude,  performance  or  skills  in  order to reduce motor vehicle accidents and  traffic violations, and to promote highway safety.  He  shall  have  the  authority to establish such programs on a limited, experimental basis in  order  to  assist in such feasibility study provided any such program is  funded by any source other than state funds, or if any such  program  is  to  be  funded with state funds, then he may establish such program only  with the approval of the director of the division of the budget."

Such fees shall defray the ongoing expenses of the program. In no  event shall  such  fee  be  refundable.  A  driver  improvement  program  established  pursuant  to  section  five  hundred twenty-three-a of this  chapter may be designated by the commissioner as a driver rehabilitation  program under this section if the curriculum and other requirements both  for the purposes of this section and section five hundred twenty-three-a  of this chapter are satisfied by such program.  Where  the  commissioner  has   approved   any  driver  improvement  program  conducted  by  local  authorities as a driver rehabilitation program under this  section,  any  fee  required for attendance at such program shall be paid to the agency  conducting such program.

Failure to report an accident as herein provided or failure to give  correctly  the  information  required  of  him  by  the  commissioner in  connection with such report shall be a misdemeanor and shall  constitute  a ground for suspension or revocation of the operator's (or chauffeur's)  license or all certificates of registration for any motor vehicle, or of  both,  of  the person failing to make such report as herein required. In  addition, the commissioner may temporarily suspend the driver's  license  or  permit  or certificate of registration of the motor vehicle involved  in the accident, or of both, of the person failing to report an accident  within the period prescribed in paragraph one of this subdivision, until  such report has been filed.

Provided,  however,  the commissioner shall not omit the event described  in such report from the operator's external license  abstract  if  as  a  result  of  such  event such operator has either (i) been charged with a  violation of this chapter or of the penal law, unless  the  commissioner  receives  evidence  that  such  charge  has  been dismissed, or that the  action has otherwise been terminated in favor of the accused pursuant to  section 160.50 of the criminal procedure law, or  that  the  charge  has  otherwise  been  adjudicated in an administrative or other proceeding in  favor of the defendant operator or (ii) been found to have been  grossly  negligent by a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction.    (b)  Every  person operating a bicycle which is in any manner involved  in an accident on a public highway in this state in which any person  is  killed,  other  than the operator, or suffers serious physical injury as  defined pursuant to subdivision ten of section 10.00 of the  penal  law,  shall  within  ten  days  after such operator learns of the fact of such  death or serious physical injury, report the matter in  writing  to  the  commissioner.  If  such  operator is physically incapable of making such  report within ten days, he or she shall make the report immediately upon  recovery  from  the  physical  incapacity.  If  such  operator   is   an  unemancipated  minor  who  is  incapable  of  making such report for any  reason, the parent or guardian of such operator shall make  such  report  within  ten days after learning of the fact of such accident.

Traffic, except pedestrians, facing a steady circular green  signal  may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such  place  prohibits  either such turn. Such traffic, including when turning  right or left, shall yield the right of way to  other  traffic  lawfully  within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal  is exhibited.    2. Traffic, except pedestrians, facing a steady green arrow signal may  cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by  such  arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications  shown at the same time, except that a U-Turn  may  be  made  by  traffic  facing  a left green arrow signal unless a sign prohibits such U-Turn or  such U-Turn is in violation of any other provision of law. Such  traffic  shall  yield  the  right  of  way  to  other traffic lawfully within the  intersection or an adjacent cross  walk  at  the  time  such  signal  is  exhibited.    3.

(b) Yellow indications:    1. Traffic, except pedestrians, facing a steady circular yellow signal  may enter the intersection; however, said traffic is thereby warned that  the  related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication  will be exhibited immediately thereafter.    2. Traffic, except pedestrians, facing a steady  yellow  arrow  signal  may  cautiously  enter  the  intersection  only to complete the movement  indicated by such arrow or make such other movement as is  permitted  by  other  indications  shown  at  the  same  time; however, said traffic is  thereby warned that the related green arrow movement is being terminated  or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.    3.  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  a  pedestrian-control  signal  as  provided in section eleven hundred twelve, pedestrians facing any steady  yellow  signal  are  thereby  advised that there is insufficient time to  cross the roadway before a red indication is  shown  and  no  pedestrian  shall then start to cross the roadway.    (d) Red indications:    1.  Traffic,  except pedestrians, facing a steady circular red signal,  unless to make such other movement as is permitted by other  indications  shown at the same time, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if  none,  then shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the near side of  the intersection, or in the event there is no crosswalk,  at  the  point  nearest  the  intersecting  roadway  where  the driver has a view of the  approaching traffic on the  intersecting  roadway  before  entering  the  intersection and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is  shown except as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision.    2. Except in a city having a population of one million or more, unless  a sign is in place prohibiting such turn:    a.  Traffic  facing  a steady circular red signal may cautiously enter  the intersection to make a right turn  after  stopping  as  required  by  paragraph  one of this subdivision, except that right turning traffic is  not required to stop when a steady right green arrow signal is shown  at  the  same time. Such traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians  within a marked or unmarked crosswalk at the intersection and  to  other  traffic lawfully using the intersection;    b. Traffic, while on a one-way roadway, facing a steady red signal may  cautiously  enter  the  intersection  to make a left turn onto a one-way  roadway after stopping as required by paragraph one of this subdivision.  Such traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians within a marked  or unmarked crosswalk at the intersection and to other traffic  lawfully  using the intersection.    c. On or after the effective date of this subparagraph, the sign which  prohibits  such  turn  shall  be  prominently  displayed  from all newly  installed traffic signals where possible.    Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  any  city  having  a  population of one million or more, is hereby authorized and empowered to  adopt  a  local law authorizing subparagraph a or b of this paragraph to  be applicable within such city. Upon the adoption of such local law  the  exception  provided herein for a city having a population of one million  or more shall no longer be applicable within such city.    3. Traffic, except pedestrians, facing a steady red arrow  signal  may  not  enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by such arrow  and, unless entering the intersection to make such other movement as  is  permitted  by  other indications shown at the same time, shall stop at a  clearly marked stop line, but if none, then shall stop  before  entering  the  crosswalk  on  the  near  side of the intersection, or in the event  there is no crosswalk at the  point  nearest  the  intersecting  roadway  where  the  driver  has  a  view  of  the  approaching  traffic  on  the  intersecting roadway before entering the intersection and  shall  remain  standing until an indication to proceed is shown.    4.  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  a  pedestrian-control  signal  as  provided in section eleven hundred twelve, pedestrians facing any steady  red signal shall not enter the roadway.    5. Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph two of this subdivision,  no school bus, while transporting  pupils  for  any  purpose,  shall  be  permitted to proceed when facing a steady red signal.    (e)  Traffic  shall  obey signs requiring obedience to traffic-control  signals at intersections other than those  at  which  such  signals  are  located.  No  intersection  not  controlled  by  such signs prior to the  effective date of this section shall hereafter be made subject  to  such  method  of control and no ordinance, order, rule or regulation requiring  such obedience shall hereafter be adopted.    (f) In the event an official traffic-control  signal  is  erected  and  maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this  section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their  nature  can  have  no  application. Any stop required shall be made at a  sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made,  but in the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at  the signal."

Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  law,  each  city  with a population of one million or more is hereby  authorized and empowered to adopt and amend a  local  law  or  ordinance  establishing  a demonstration program imposing monetary liability on the  owner of a vehicle for failure of an operator  thereof  to  comply  with  traffic-control   indications  in  such  city  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of this section. Such demonstration program shall  empower  a  city    to    install   and   operate   traffic-control   signal   photo  violation-monitoring  devices  at  no  more  than  one   hundred   fifty  intersections within such city at any one time.    2.  Such demonstration program shall utilize necessary technologies to  ensure, to the extent practicable, that  photographs  produced  by  such  traffic-control  signal  photo  violation-monitoring  systems  shall not  include images that identify the driver, the passengers, or the contents  of the vehicle. Provided, however, that no notice  of  liability  issued  pursuant  to this section shall be dismissed solely because a photograph  or photographs allow  for  the  identification  of  the  contents  of  a  vehicle,  provided that such city has made a reasonable effort to comply  with the provisions of this paragraph.    (b) In any city which has adopted a local law or ordinance pursuant to  subdivision (a) of this section, the owner of a vehicle shall be  liable  for  a penalty imposed pursuant to this section if such vehicle was used  or operated with the permission of the owner,  express  or  implied,  in  violation  of  subdivision  (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of this  article, and such violation is evidenced by information obtained from  a  traffic-control   signal  photo  violation-monitoring  system;  provided  however that no owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a penalty imposed  pursuant to this section where the operator of  such  vehicle  has  been  convicted  of  the  underlying  violation  of subdivision (d) of section  eleven hundred eleven of this article.

(i)  In  such  city  which,  by  local  law,  has  authorized  the  adjudication  of  liability  imposed  upon  owners  by this section by a  parking violations bureau, an owner who is a  lessor  of  a  vehicle  to  which  a  notice  of liability was issued pursuant to subdivision (g) of  this section shall not be liable for the violation of subdivision (d) of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article, provided that:    (A) prior to the violation, the lessor has filed with  the  bureau  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of section two hundred thirty-nine of  this chapter; and    (B) within thirty-seven days after receiving notice from the bureau of  the date and time of a liability, together with  the  other  information  contained in the original notice of liability, the lessor submits to the  bureau  the  correct  name  and  address  of  the  lessee of the vehicle  identified in the notice of liability at the  time  of  such  violation,  together with such other additional information contained in the rental,  lease  or  other contract document, as may be reasonably required by the  bureau pursuant to regulations that may be promulgated for such purpose.

(k)  1.  If  the  owner  liable  for a violation of subdivision (d) of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article pursuant to  this  section  was  not  the  operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the  owner may maintain an action for indemnification against the operator.    2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no owner of  a  vehicle  shall  be  subject  to a monetary fine imposed pursuant to this  section if the operator of  such  vehicle  was  operating  such  vehicle  without  the  consent  of  the owner at the time such operator failed to  obey a traffic-control indication.

Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  law, the city of Buffalo is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt  and amend a local law or ordinance establishing a demonstration  program  imposing  monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle for failure of an  operator thereof to comply with traffic-control indications in such city  in accordance with the provisions of this  section.  Such  demonstration  program  shall  empower such city to install and operate traffic-control  signal  photo  violation-monitoring  devices  at  no  more  than   fifty  intersections within such city at any one time.    2.  Such demonstration program shall utilize necessary technologies to  ensure, to the extent practicable, that  photographs  produced  by  such  traffic-control  signal  photo  violation-monitoring  systems  shall not  include images that identify the driver, the passengers, or the contents  of the vehicle. Provided, however, that no notice  of  liability  issued  pursuant  to this section shall be dismissed solely because a photograph  or photographs allow  for  the  identification  of  the  contents  of  a  vehicle,  provided that such city has made a reasonable effort to comply  with the provisions of this paragraph.    (b) In any such city which  has  adopted  a  local  law  or  ordinance  pursuant  to  subdivision  (a)  of  this section, the owner of a vehicle  shall be liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to this section  if  such  vehicle  was  used or operated with the permission of the owner, express  or implied, in violation of subdivision (d) of  section  eleven  hundred  eleven  of  this article, and such violation is evidenced by information  obtained  from  a  traffic-control  signal  photo   violation-monitoring  system;  provided however that no owner of a vehicle shall be liable for  a penalty imposed pursuant to this section where the  operator  of  such  vehicle  has  been  convicted of the underlying violation of subdivision  (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of this article.    (c) For purposes of this  section,  ""owner""  shall  have  the  meaning  provided in article two-B of this chapter. For purposes of this section,  ""traffic-control  signal photo violation-monitoring system"" shall mean a  vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction with  a  traffic-control  signal which automatically produces two or more photographs, two or more  microphotographs,  a  videotape or other recorded images of each vehicle  at the time it is used or operated in violation of  subdivision  (d)  of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article.    (d)  A  certificate,  sworn to or affirmed by a technician employed by  the city of Buffalo in  which  the  charged  violation  occurred,  or  a  facsimile    thereof,    based    upon    inspection   of   photographs,  microphotographs, videotape or  other  recorded  images  produced  by  a  traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system, shall be prima  facie   evidence  of  the  facts  contained  therein.  Any  photographs,  microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images evidencing  such  a  violation  shall  be  available  for  inspection  in  any  proceeding to  adjudicate the liability for such violation pursuant to a local  law  or  ordinance adopted pursuant to this section.    (e)  An  owner  liable  for  a violation of subdivision (d) of section  eleven hundred eleven of  this  article  pursuant  to  a  local  law  or  ordinance  adopted pursuant to this section shall be liable for monetary  penalties in accordance with a schedule of fines and penalties to be set  forth in such local law or ordinance, except that if such city by  local  law has authorized the adjudication of such owner liability by a parking  violations  bureau,  such  schedule shall be promulgated by such bureau.  The liability of the owner pursuant to this  section  shall  not  exceed  fifty dollars for each violation; provided, however, that such local law  or  ordinance  may  provide  for  an additional penalty not in excess of  twenty-five dollars for each violation for the failure to respond  to  a  notice of liability within the prescribed time period.    (f)  An imposition of liability under a local law or ordinance adopted  pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a conviction as an operator  and shall not be made part of the operating record of  the  person  upon  whom  such  liability  is  imposed  nor  shall  it be used for insurance  purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage.    (g) 1. A notice of liability shall be sent by first class mail to each  person alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation  of  subdivision  (d)  of  section  eleven hundred eleven of this article pursuant to this  section. Personal delivery on the owner shall not be required. A  manual  or  automatic  record  of  mailing  prepared  in  the ordinary course of  business shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.    2. A notice of liability shall contain the name  and  address  of  the  person  alleged  to be liable as an owner for a violation of subdivision  (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of this article  pursuant  to  this  section,  the  registration  number  of  the  vehicle  involved  in such  violation, the location where such violation took place,  the  date  and  time of such violation and the identification number of the camera which  recorded the violation or other document locator number.    3.  The  notice  of  liability  shall contain information advising the  person charged of the manner and the time in which he  may  contest  the  liability  alleged  in  the  notice. Such notice of liability shall also  contain a warning to advise the persons charged that failure to  contest  in  the  manner  and  time  provided  shall  be  deemed  an admission of  liability and that a default judgment may be entered thereon.    4. The notice of liability shall be prepared and mailed by the city of  Buffalo, or by any other entity authorized by such city to  prepare  and  mail such notification of violation.    (h)  Adjudication of the liability imposed upon owners by this section  shall be by the court  having  jurisdiction  over  traffic  infractions,  except  that  if such city has established an administrative tribunal to  hear  and  determine  complaints  of  traffic  infractions  constituting  parking,  standing  or  stopping violations such city may, by local law,  authorize such adjudication by such tribunal.    (i) If an owner receives  a  notice  of  liability  pursuant  to  this  section for any time period during which the vehicle was reported to the  police  department as having been stolen, it shall be a valid defense to  an allegation of liability for a violation of subdivision (d) of section  eleven hundred eleven of this article pursuant to this section that  the  vehicle  had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time the  violation occurred and had not been recovered by such time. For purposes  of asserting the defense  provided  by  this  subdivision  it  shall  be  sufficient  that  a  certified  copy  of the police report on the stolen  vehicle be sent by first class mail to the  traffic  violations  bureau,  court having jurisdiction or parking violations bureau.    (j)  1.  In such city where the adjudication of liability imposed upon  owners pursuant to this section is by a court  having  jurisdiction,  an  owner  who  is  a lessor of a vehicle to which a notice of liability was  issued pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section shall not  be  liable  for the violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of  this  article,  provided  that  he  or  she  sends  to  the court having  jurisdiction a copy of the rental, lease or other such contract document  covering such vehicle on the date of the violation, with  the  name  and  address  of  the  lessee clearly legible, within thirty-seven days after  receiving notice from the court of the date and time of such  violation,  together  with the other information contained in the original notice of  liability. Failure to send such information within such thirty-seven day  time period shall render the owner liable for the penalty prescribed  by  this  section.  Where  the  lessor  complies with the provisions of this  paragraph, the lessee of such vehicle on  the  date  of  such  violation  shall  be  deemed  to  be the owner of such vehicle for purposes of this  section, shall be subject to liability for the violation of  subdivision  (d)  of  section  eleven hundred eleven of this article pursuant to this  section and shall be sent a notice of liability pursuant to  subdivision  (g) of this section.    2.  (i)  In  such  city  which,  by  local  law,  has  authorized  the  adjudication of liability imposed upon  owners  by  this  section  by  a  parking  violations  bureau,  an  owner  who is a lessor of a vehicle to  which a notice of liability was issued pursuant to  subdivision  (g)  of  this section shall not be liable for the violation of subdivision (d) of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article, provided that:    (A)  prior  to  the violation, the lessor has filed with the bureau in  accordance with the provisions of section  two  hundred  thirty-nine  of  this chapter; and    (B) within thirty-seven days after receiving notice from the bureau of  the  date  and  time of a liability, together with the other information  contained in the original notice of liability, the lessor submits to the  bureau the correct name  and  address  of  the  lessee  of  the  vehicle  identified  in  the  notice  of liability at the time of such violation,  together with such other additional information contained in the rental,  lease or other contract document, as may be reasonably required  by  the  bureau pursuant to regulations that may be promulgated for such purpose.    (ii)  Failure  to  comply  with clause (B) of subparagraph (i) of this  paragraph shall render the owner liable for the  penalty  prescribed  in  this section.    (iii) Where the lessor complies with the provisions of this paragraph,  the lessee of such vehicle on the date of such violation shall be deemed  to  be  the owner of such vehicle for purposes of this section, shall be  subject to liability for such violation pursuant  to  this  section  and  shall  be sent a notice of liability pursuant to subdivision (g) of this  section.    (k) 1. If the owner liable for  a  violation  of  subdivision  (d)  of  section  eleven  hundred eleven of this article pursuant to this section  was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of  the  violation,  the  owner may maintain an action for indemnification against the operator.    2.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no owner of a  vehicle shall be subject to a monetary fine  imposed  pursuant  to  this  section  if  the  operator  of  such  vehicle was operating such vehicle  without the consent of the owner at the time  such  operator  failed  to  obey  a  traffic-control  indication.  For  purposes of this subdivision  there shall be a presumption that  the  operator  of  such  vehicle  was  operating  such  vehicle  with the consent of the owner at the time such  operator failed to obey a traffic-control indication.    (l) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the  liability  of  an  operator  of  a  vehicle for any violation of subdivision (d) of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article.    (m) In any such city which adopts a demonstration program pursuant  to  subdivision (a) of this section, such city shall submit an annual report  on   the   results   of  the  use  of  a  traffic-control  signal  photo  violation-monitoring system to the governor, the temporary president  of  the  senate and the speaker of the assembly on or before June first, two  thousand ten and on the same date in each succeeding year in  which  the  demonstration program is operable. Such report shall include, but not be  limited to:    1.  a  description of the locations where traffic-control signal photo  violation-monitoring systems were used;    2.  the  aggregate  number, type and severity of accidents reported at  intersections where a traffic-control signal photo  violation-monitoring  system  is  used for the year preceding the installation of such system,  to the extent the information is maintained by the department  of  motor  vehicles of this state;    3.  the  aggregate  number, type and severity of accidents reported at  intersections where a traffic-control signal photo  violation-monitoring  system  is  used,  to  the  extent  the information is maintained by the  department of motor vehicles of this state;    4. the number of violations recorded  at  each  intersection  where  a  traffic-control  signal photo violation-monitoring system is used and in  the aggregate on a daily, weekly and monthly basis;    5. the total number of notices  of  liability  issued  for  violations  recorded by such systems;    6.  the  number  of  fines  and total amount of fines paid after first  notice of liability issued for violations recorded by such systems;    7.  the  number  of  violations  adjudicated  and  results   of   such  adjudications  including  breakdowns of dispositions made for violations  recorded by such systems;    8. the total amount  of  revenue  realized  by  such  city  from  such  adjudications;    9. expenses incurred by such city in connection with the program; and    10. quality of the adjudication process and its results.

For purposes  of  asserting  the  defense  provided  by  this  subdivision it shall be  sufficient that a certified copy of the  police  report  on  the  stolen  vehicle  be  sent  by first class mail to the traffic violations bureau,  court having jurisdiction or parking violations bureau.

Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  law,  the  county  of  Suffolk is hereby authorized and empowered to  adopt and amend a local law or ordinance  establishing  a  demonstration  program  imposing  monetary  liability  on  the  owner  of a vehicle for  failure  of  an  operator  thereof  to   comply   with   traffic-control  indications  in  such  county  in accordance with the provisions of this  section. Such demonstration program shall empower such county to install  and operate traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring devices at  no more than one hundred intersections within and under the jurisdiction  of such county at any one time.    2. Such demonstration program shall utilize necessary technologies  to  ensure,  to  the  extent  practicable, that photographs produced by such  traffic-control signal  photo  violation-monitoring  systems  shall  not  include images that identify the driver, the passengers, or the contents  of  the  vehicle.  Provided, however, that no notice of liability issued  pursuant to this section shall be dismissed solely because a  photograph  or  photographs  allow  for  the  identification  of  the  contents of a  vehicle, provided that such county  has  made  a  reasonable  effort  to  comply with the provisions of this paragraph.    (b)  In  any  such  county  which has adopted a local law or ordinance  pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section,  the  owner  of  a  vehicle  shall  be  liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to this section if such  vehicle was used or operated with the permission of the  owner,  express  or  implied,  in  violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred  eleven of this article, and such violation is evidenced  by  information  obtained   from  a  traffic-control  signal  photo  violation-monitoring  system; provided however that no owner of a vehicle shall be liable  for  a  penalty  imposed  pursuant to this section where the operator of such  vehicle has been convicted of the underlying  violation  of  subdivision  (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of this article.

(d) A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by a  technician  employed  by  Suffolk  county  in which the charged violation occurred, or a facsimile  thereof,  based  upon  inspection  of   photographs,   microphotographs,  videotape  or other recorded images produced by a traffic-control signal  photo violation-monitoring system, shall be prima facie evidence of  the  facts contained therein. Any photographs, microphotographs, videotape or  other recorded images evidencing such a violation shall be available for  inspection  in  any  proceeding  to  adjudicate  the  liability for such  violation pursuant to a local law or ordinance adopted pursuant to  this  section.

(f)  An imposition of liability under a local law or ordinance adopted  pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a conviction as an operator  and shall not be made part of the operating record of  the  person  upon  whom  such  liability  is  imposed  nor  shall  it be used for insurance  purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage.    (g) 1. A notice of liability shall be sent by first class mail to each  person alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation  of  subdivision  (d)  of  section  eleven hundred eleven of this article pursuant to this  section.

The  notice  of  liability  shall contain information advising the  person charged of the manner and the time in which he or she may contest  the liability alleged in the notice. Such notice of liability shall also  contain a warning to advise the persons charged that failure to  contest  in  the  manner  and  time  provided  shall  be  deemed  an admission of  liability and that a default judgment may be entered thereon.    4.

(h) Adjudication of the liability imposed upon owners by this  section  shall be by the court having jurisdiction over traffic infractions.    (i)  If  an  owner  receives  a  notice  of liability pursuant to this  section for any time period during which the vehicle was reported to the  police department as having been stolen, it shall be a valid defense  to  an allegation of liability for a violation of subdivision (d) of section  eleven  hundred eleven of this article pursuant to this section that the  vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time  the  violation occurred and had not been recovered by such time. For purposes  of  asserting  the  defense  provided  by  this  subdivision it shall be  sufficient that a certified copy of the  police  report  on  the  stolen  vehicle be sent by first class mail to the court having jurisdiction.    (j)  An  owner  who  is  a  lessor  of  a vehicle to which a notice of  liability was issued pursuant to subdivision (g) of this  section  shall  not  be  liable  for  the violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven  hundred eleven of this article, provided that he or  she  sends  to  the  court  having  jurisdiction  a  copy  of the rental, lease or other such  contract document covering such vehicle on the date  of  the  violation,  with  the  name  and  address  of  the  lessee  clearly  legible, within  thirty-seven days after receiving notice from the court of the date  and  time of such violation, together with the other information contained in  the  original  notice  of  liability.  Failure  to send such information  within such thirty-seven day time period shall render the  owner  liable  for  the  penalty  prescribed by this section. Where the lessor complies  with the provisions of this paragraph, the lessee of such vehicle on the  date of such violation shall be deemed to be the owner of  such  vehicle  for  purposes  of  this  section,  shall be subject to liability for the  violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred  eleven  of  this  article pursuant to this section and shall be sent a notice of liability  pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section.    (k)  1.  If  the  owner  liable  for a violation of subdivision (d) of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article pursuant to  this  section  was  not  the  operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the  owner may maintain an action for indemnification against the operator.    2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no owner of  a  vehicle  shall  be  subject  to a monetary fine imposed pursuant to this  section if the operator of  such  vehicle  was  operating  such  vehicle  without  the  consent  of  the owner at the time such operator failed to  obey a traffic-control indication.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision  there  shall  be  a  presumption  that  the operator of such vehicle was  operating such vehicle with the consent of the owner at  the  time  such  operator failed to obey a traffic-control indication.    (l)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability  of an operator of a vehicle for any  violation  of  subdivision  (d)  of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article.

(I)  In  such  city  which,  by  local  law,  has  authorized  the  adjudication  of  liability  imposed  upon  owners  by this section by a  parking violations bureau, an owner who is a  lessor  of  a  vehicle  to  which  a  notice  of liability was issued pursuant to subdivision (g) of  this section shall not be liable for the violation of subdivision (d) of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article, provided that:    (A) prior to the violation, the lessor has filed with  the  bureau  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of section two hundred thirty-nine of  this chapter; and    (B) within thirty-seven days after receiving notice from the bureau of  the date and time of a liability, together with  the  other  information  contained in the original notice of liability, the lessor submits to the  bureau  the  correct  name  and  address  of  the  lessee of the vehicle  identified in the notice of liability at the  time  of  such  violation,  together with such other additional information contained in the rental,  lease  or  other contract document, as may be reasonably required by the  bureau pursuant to regulations that may be promulgated for such purpose.

(k)  1.  If  the  owner  liable  for a violation of subdivision (d) of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article pursuant to  this  section  was  not  the  operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the  owner may maintain an action for indemnification against the operator.    2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no owner of  a  vehicle  shall  be  subject  to a monetary fine imposed pursuant to this  section if the operator of  such  vehicle  was  operating  such  vehicle  without  the  consent  of  the owner at the time such operator failed to  obey a traffic-control indication.

Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  law,  the city of Albany is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt  and amend a local law or ordinance establishing a demonstration  program  imposing  monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle for failure of an  operator thereof to comply with traffic-control indications in such city  in accordance with the provisions of this  section.  Such  demonstration  program  shall  empower such city to install and operate traffic-control  signal  photo  violation-monitoring  devices  at  no  more  than  twenty  intersections within such city at any one time.    2.  Such demonstration program shall utilize necessary technologies to  ensure, to the extent practicable, that  photographs  produced  by  such  traffic-control  signal  photo  violation-monitoring  systems  shall not  include images that identify the driver, the passengers, or the contents  of the vehicle. Provided, however, that no notice  of  liability  issued  pursuant  to this section shall be dismissed solely because a photograph  or photographs allow  for  the  identification  of  the  contents  of  a  vehicle,  provided that such city has made a reasonable effort to comply  with the provisions of this paragraph.    (b) In any such city which  has  adopted  a  local  law  or  ordinance  pursuant  to  subdivision  (a)  of  this section, the owner of a vehicle  shall be liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to this section  if  such  vehicle  was  used or operated with the permission of the owner, express  or implied, in violation of subdivision (d) of  section  eleven  hundred  eleven  of  this article, and such violation is evidenced by information  obtained  from  a  traffic-control  signal  photo   violation-monitoring  system;  provided however that no owner of a vehicle shall be liable for  a penalty imposed pursuant to this section where the  operator  of  such  vehicle  has  been  convicted of the underlying violation of subdivision  (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of this article.    (c) For purposes of this  section,  ""owner""  shall  have  the  meaning  provided in article two-B of this chapter. For purposes of this section,  ""traffic-control  signal photo violation-monitoring system"" shall mean a  vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction with  a  traffic-control  signal which automatically produces two or more photographs, two or more  microphotographs,  a  videotape or other recorded images of each vehicle  at the time it is used or operated in violation of  subdivision  (d)  of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article.    (d)  A  certificate,  sworn to or affirmed by a technician employed by  the city of Albany  in  which  the  charged  violation  occurred,  or  a  facsimile    thereof,    based    upon    inspection   of   photographs,  microphotographs, videotape or  other  recorded  images  produced  by  a  traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system, shall be prima  facie   evidence  of  the  facts  contained  therein.  Any  photographs,  microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images evidencing  such  a  violation  shall  be  available  for  inspection  in  any  proceeding to  adjudicate the liability for such violation pursuant to a local  law  or  ordinance adopted pursuant to this section.    (e)  An  owner  liable  for  a violation of subdivision (d) of section  eleven hundred eleven of  this  article  pursuant  to  a  local  law  or  ordinance  adopted pursuant to this section shall be liable for monetary  penalties in accordance with a schedule of fines and penalties to be set  forth in such local law or ordinance, except that if such city by  local  law has authorized the adjudication of such owner liability by a parking  violations  bureau,  such  schedule shall be promulgated by such bureau.  The liability of the owner pursuant to this  section  shall  not  exceed  fifty dollars for each violation; provided, however, that such local law  or  ordinance  may  provide  for  an additional penalty not in excess of  twenty-five dollars for each violation for the failure to respond  to  a  notice of liability within the prescribed time period.    (f)  An imposition of liability under a local law or ordinance adopted  pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a conviction as an operator  and shall not be made part of the operating record of  the  person  upon  whom  such  liability  is  imposed  nor  shall  it be used for insurance  purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage.    (g) 1. A notice of liability shall be sent by first class mail to each  person alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation  of  subdivision  (d)  of  section  eleven hundred eleven of this article pursuant to this  section. Personal delivery on the owner shall not be required. A  manual  or  automatic  record  of  mailing  prepared  in  the ordinary course of  business shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.    2. A notice of liability shall contain the name  and  address  of  the  person  alleged  to be liable as an owner for a violation of subdivision  (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of this article  pursuant  to  this  section,  the  registration  number  of  the  vehicle  involved  in such  violation, the location where such violation took place,  the  date  and  time of such violation and the identification number of the camera which  recorded the violation or other document locator number.    3.  The  notice  of  liability  shall contain information advising the  person charged of the manner and the time in which he or she may contest  the liability alleged in the notice. Such notice of liability shall also  contain a warning to advise the persons charged that failure to  contest  in  the  manner  and  time  provided  shall  be  deemed  an admission of  liability and that a default judgment may be entered thereon.    4. The notice of liability shall be prepared and mailed by the city of  Albany, or by any other entity authorized by such city  to  prepare  and  mail such notification of violation.    (h)  Adjudication of the liability imposed upon owners by this section  shall be by a traffic violations bureau established pursuant to  section  three hundred seventy of the general municipal law or, if there be none,  by  the  court having jurisdiction over traffic infractions, except that  if such city has established an  administrative  tribunal  to  hear  and  determine   complaints  of  traffic  infractions  constituting  parking,  standing or stopping violations such city may, by local  law,  authorize  such adjudication by such tribunal.    (i)  If  an  owner  receives  a  notice  of liability pursuant to this  section for any time period during which the vehicle was reported to the  police department as having been stolen, it shall be a valid defense  to  an allegation of liability for a violation of subdivision (d) of section  eleven  hundred eleven of this article pursuant to this section that the  vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time  the  violation occurred and had not been recovered by such time. For purposes  of  asserting  the  defense  provided  by  this  subdivision it shall be  sufficient that a certified copy of the  police  report  on  the  stolen  vehicle  be  sent  by first class mail to the traffic violations bureau,  court having jurisdiction or parking violations bureau.

Failure to send such information within such thirty-seven day  time  period shall render the owner liable for the penalty prescribed by  this section. Where the lessor complies  with  the  provisions  of  this  paragraph,  the  lessee  of  such  vehicle on the date of such violation  shall be deemed to be the owner of such vehicle  for  purposes  of  this  section,  shall be subject to liability for the violation of subdivision  (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of this article  pursuant  to  this  section  and shall be sent a notice of liability pursuant to subdivision  (g) of this section.    2.  (I)  In  such  city  which,  by  local  law,  has  authorized  the  adjudication  of  liability  imposed  upon  owners  by this section by a  parking violations bureau, an owner who is a  lessor  of  a  vehicle  to  which  a  notice  of liability was issued pursuant to subdivision (g) of  this section shall not be liable for the violation of subdivision (d) of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article, provided that:    (A) prior to the violation, the lessor has filed with  the  bureau  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of section two hundred thirty-nine of  this chapter; and    (B) within thirty-seven days after receiving notice from the bureau of  the date and time of a liability, together with  the  other  information  contained in the original notice of liability, the lessor submits to the  bureau  the  correct  name  and  address  of  the  lessee of the vehicle  identified in the notice of liability at the  time  of  such  violation,  together with such other additional information contained in the rental,  lease  or  other contract document, as may be reasonably required by the  bureau pursuant to regulations that may be promulgated for such purpose.    (II) Failure to comply with clause (B) of  subparagraph  (I)  of  this  paragraph  shall  render  the owner liable for the penalty prescribed in  this section.    (III) Where the lessor complies with the provisions of this paragraph,  the lessee of such vehicle on the date of such violation shall be deemed  to be the owner of such vehicle for purposes of this section,  shall  be  subject  to  liability  for  such violation pursuant to this section and  shall be sent a notice of liability pursuant to subdivision (g) of  this  section.    (k)  1.  If  the  owner  liable  for a violation of subdivision (d) of  section eleven hundred eleven of this article pursuant to  this  section  was  not  the  operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the  owner may maintain an action for indemnification against the operator.    2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no owner of  a  vehicle  shall  be  subject  to a monetary fine imposed pursuant to this  section if the operator of  such  vehicle  was  operating  such  vehicle  without  the  consent  of  the owner at the time such operator failed to  obey a traffic-control indication.  For  purposes  of  this  subdivision  there  shall  be  a  presumption  that  the operator of such vehicle was  operating such vehicle with the consent of the owner at  the  time  such  operator failed to obey a traffic-control indication.

In selecting a school speed zone  in  which  to  install  and  operate  a  photo  speed  violation monitoring system, the  counties shall consider criteria including, but not limited to the speed  data, crash history, and the roadway geometry applicable to such  school  speed zone.    2.  No  photo  speed  violation  monitoring  system shall be used in a  school speed zone unless (i) on  the  day  it  is  to  be  used  it  has  successfully  passed  a  self-test  of  its  functions;  and (ii) it has  undergone an annual calibration check performed  pursuant  to  paragraph  four  of  this subdivision. The counties may install signs giving notice  that a photo speed violation monitoring system is in use to  be  mounted  on  advance  warning  signs  notifying  motor  vehicle operators of such  upcoming school speed zone and/or on speed limit signs applicable within  such school speed zone, in conformance with standards established in the  MUTCD.    3. Operators of photo speed violation monitoring  systems  shall  have  completed  training  in  the  procedures  for  setting  up, testing, and  operating such systems. Each such operator shall  complete  and  sign  a  daily  set-up  log for each such system that he or she operates that (i)  states the date and time when, and the location where,  the  system  was  set  up  that  day,  and  (ii)  states  that  such operator successfully  performed, and the system passed, the self-tests of such  system  before  producing a recorded image that day. The counties shall retain each such  daily log until the later of the date on which the photo speed violation  monitoring  system to which it applies has been permanently removed from  use or the final resolution of all cases involving notices of  liability  issued  based  on photographs, microphotographs, video or other recorded  images produced by such system.    4. Each photo speed  violation  monitoring  system  shall  undergo  an  annual   calibration  check  performed  by  an  independent  calibration  laboratory which shall issue a signed certificate  of  calibration.  The  counties  shall keep each such annual certificate of calibration on file  until the final resolution of all cases involving a notice of  liability  issued   during   such   year   which   were   based   on   photographs,  microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images  produced  by  such  photo speed violation monitoring system.    5. (i) Such demonstration program shall utilize necessary technologies  to    ensure,    to    the   extent   practicable,   that   photographs,  microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images  produced  by  such  photo  speed  violation monitoring systems shall not include images that  identify the driver, the passengers, or the  contents  of  the  vehicle.  Provided,  however,  that no notice of liability issued pursuant to this  section  shall  be  dismissed  solely   because   such   a   photograph,  microphotograph,  videotape  or  other  recorded  image  allows  for the  identification of  the  driver,  the  passengers,  or  the  contents  of  vehicles  where  either  county,  as  applicable,  shows  that  it  made  reasonable efforts to comply with the provisions of  this  paragraph  in  such case.    (ii)  Photographs,  microphotographs,  videotape or any other recorded  image from a photo speed violation monitoring system shall  be  for  the  exclusive use of each such county for the purpose of the adjudication of  liability  imposed pursuant to this section and of the owner receiving a  notice of liability pursuant to this section, and shall be destroyed  by  each such county upon the final resolution of the notice of liability to  which  such  photographs,  microphotographs, videotape or other recorded  images relate, or one year following the date of issuance of such notice  of liability, whichever is later. Notwithstanding the provisions of  any  other   law,   rule   or   regulation   to  the  contrary,  photographs,  microphotographs, videotape or any other recorded  image  from  a  photo  speed  violation  monitoring system shall not be open to the public, nor  subject to civil or criminal process or discovery, nor used by any court  or administrative or adjudicatory  body  in  any  action  or  proceeding  therein  except that which is necessary for the adjudication of a notice  of liability issued pursuant to this section, and no  public  entity  or  employee,  officer  or  agent  thereof  shall disclose such information,  except that such photographs, microphotographs, videotape or  any  other  recorded images from such systems:    (A) shall be available for inspection and copying and use by the motor  vehicle   owner   and   operator   for  so  long  as  such  photographs,  microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images are required to  be  maintained or are maintained by such public entity, employee, officer or  agent; and    (B)  (1)  shall be furnished when described in a search warrant issued  by a court authorized to issue such a search warrant pursuant to article  six hundred ninety of the criminal procedure  law  or  a  federal  court  authorized  to issue such a search warrant under federal law, where such  search warrant states that there is reasonable  cause  to  believe  such  information  constitutes  evidence  of,  or tends to demonstrate that, a  misdemeanor or felony offense was committed in  this  state  or  another  state,  or  that a particular person participated in the commission of a  misdemeanor or felony offense in this state or another state,  provided,  however, that if such offense was against the laws of another state, the  court  shall only issue a warrant if the conduct comprising such offense  would, if occurring in this state, constitute a  misdemeanor  or  felony  against the laws of this state; and    (2) shall be furnished in response to a subpoena duces tecum signed by  a  judge  of  competent  jurisdiction and issued pursuant to article six  hundred ten of the criminal procedure law or a judge or magistrate of  a  federal  court  authorized  to  issue  such a subpoena duces tecum under  federal law, where the judge finds and the subpoena states that there is  reasonable cause to believe such information is relevant and material to  the prosecution, or the defense, or the investigation by  an  authorized  law  enforcement official, of the alleged commission of a misdemeanor or  felony  in  this state or another state, provided, however, that if such  offense was against the laws of another state, such judge or  magistrate  shall  only  issue  such subpoena if the conduct comprising such offense  would, if occurring in this state, constitute a misdemeanor or felony in  this state; and    (3) may, if lawfully obtained pursuant to this clause and  clause  (A)  of  this subparagraph and otherwise admissible, be used in such criminal  action or proceeding.    (b) If the counties of Nassau and Suffolk  establish  a  demonstration  program  pursuant  to  subdivision  (a)  of this section, the owner of a  vehicle shall be liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to  this  section  if  such  vehicle was used or operated with the permission of the owner,  express  or  implied,  within  a  school  speed  zone  in  violation  of  subdivision  (c)  of  section  eleven  hundred eighty of this article or  during the times authorized pursuant to subdivision (a) of this  section  in  violation  of  subdivision  (b),  (d),  (f) or (g) of section eleven  hundred eighty of this article, such vehicle was traveling at a speed of  more than ten miles per hour above the  posted  speed  limit  in  effect  within  such  school  speed  zone,  and  such  violation is evidenced by  information obtained from a photo  speed  violation  monitoring  system;  provided  however  that  no  owner  of  a  vehicle shall be liable for a  penalty imposed pursuant to this section  where  the  operator  of  such  vehicle  has  been  convicted of the underlying violation of subdivision  (b), (c), (d), (f) or (g) of  section  eleven  hundred  eighty  of  this  article.

(g) 1. A notice of liability shall be sent by first class mail to each  person  alleged  to be liable as an owner for a violation of subdivision  (b), (c), (d), (f) or (g) of  section  eleven  hundred  eighty  of  this  article  pursuant to this section, within fourteen business days if such  owner is a resident of this state and within forty-five business days if  such owner is a non-resident.

Failure  to  send  such  information  within  such  thirty-seven day time period shall render the  owner liable for the penalty  prescribed  by  this  section.  Where  the  lessor  complies  with  the  provisions of this paragraph, the lessee of  such vehicle on the date of such violation shall be  deemed  to  be  the  owner  of such vehicle for purposes of this section, shall be subject to  liability for the violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d), (f) or (g)  of  section  eleven  hundred eighty of this article pursuant to this section  and shall be sent a notice of liability pursuant to subdivision  (g)  of  this section.

If the owner liable for a violation of subdivision (c) or (d)  of section eleven hundred  eighty  of  this  article  pursuant  to  this  section  was  not  the  operator  of  the  vehicle  at  the  time of the  violation, the owner may maintain an action for indemnification  against  the operator.    2.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no owner of a  vehicle shall be subject to a monetary fine  imposed  pursuant  to  this  section  if  the  operator  of  such  vehicle was operating such vehicle  without the consent of the owner at the time such operator operated such  vehicle in violation of subdivision (b), (c), (d), (f) or (g) of section  eleven hundred eighty of this article. For purposes of this  subdivision  there  shall  be  a  presumption  that  the operator of such vehicle was  operating such vehicle with the consent of the owner at  the  time  such  operator  operated  such  vehicle  in violation of subdivision (b), (c),  (d), (f) or (g) of section eleven hundred eighty of this article.

Provided, however, that if  such conduct, had it occurred in this state, would  have  constituted  a  violation of any provisions of this section which are not misdemeanor or  felony  offenses,  then  such  conduct  shall  be  deemed  to be a prior  conviction of a  violation  of  subdivision  one  of  this  section  for  purposes  of  determining  penalties  imposed  under this section or for  purposes of any administrative action required to be taken  pursuant  to  subdivision two of section eleven hundred ninety-three of this article.    8-a.

A driver may be convicted of a  violation  of  subdivision  one,  two  or   three   of   this   section,  notwithstanding  that  the  charge  laid  before  the  court  alleged  a  violation of subdivision two or three of this section, and regardless of  whether or not such conviction is based on a plea of guilty.    10. Plea bargain limitations.  (a) (i) In any case wherein the  charge  laid  before  the  court  alleges a violation of subdivision two, three,  four or four-a of this section, any plea of guilty thereafter entered in  satisfaction of such charge must include at least a plea  of  guilty  to  the  violation  of  the  provisions  of  one of the subdivisions of this  section, other than subdivision five or six, and no other disposition by  plea of guilty to any other charge in satisfaction of such charge  shall  be  authorized;  provided,  however,  if  the  district  attorney,  upon  reviewing the available  evidence,  determines  that  the  charge  of  a  violation  of  this section is not warranted, such district attorney may  consent, and the court may allow a disposition  by  plea  of  guilty  to  another charge in satisfaction of such charge; provided, however, in all  such cases, the court shall set forth upon the record the basis for such  disposition.    (ii)  In  any  case wherein the charge laid before the court alleges a  violation of subdivision two, three, four or four-a of this section,  no  plea  of  guilty to subdivision one of this section shall be accepted by  the  court  unless  such  plea  includes  as  a  condition  thereof  the  requirement  that the defendant attend and complete the alcohol and drug  rehabilitation program established pursuant to  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-six  of  this  article,  including  any  assessment and treatment  required thereby; provided, however, that such requirement may be waived  by the court upon application of the district attorney or the  defendant  demonstrating  that  the defendant, as a condition of the plea, has been  required to enter into and complete an alcohol or drug treatment program  prescribed pursuant to  an  alcohol  or  substance  abuse  screening  or  assessment  conducted  pursuant to section eleven hundred ninety-eight-a  of this article or for other good cause shown. The  provisions  of  this  subparagraph  shall  apply, notwithstanding any bars to participation in  the alcohol and drug rehabilitation program set forth in section  eleven  hundred  ninety-six  of this article; provided, however, that nothing in  this paragraph shall authorize the issuance  of  a  conditional  license  unless otherwise authorized by law.    (iii)  In  any case wherein the charge laid before the court alleges a  violation of subdivision one of this section and the operator was  under  the  age of twenty-one at the time of such violation, any plea of guilty  thereafter entered in satisfaction of such charge must include at  least  a  plea  of  guilty  to  the  violation  of  such subdivision; provided,  however, such charge may instead be satisfied as provided  in  paragraph  (c)  of  this  subdivision,  and, provided further that, if the district  attorney, upon reviewing the available  evidence,  determines  that  the  charge  of  a  violation  of  subdivision  one  of  this  section is not  warranted, such district attorney may consent, and the court may allow a  disposition by plea of guilty to another charge in satisfaction of  such  charge;  provided, however, in all such cases, the court shall set forth  upon the record the basis for such disposition.    (b) In any case wherein the charge laid before  the  court  alleges  a  violation  of  subdivision  one or six of this section while operating a  commercial motor vehicle, any  plea  of  guilty  thereafter  entered  in  satisfaction  of  such  charge must include at least a plea of guilty to  the violation of the provisions of  one  of  the  subdivisions  of  this  section  and  no other disposition by plea of guilty to any other charge  in satisfaction of such charge shall be authorized;  provided,  however,  if   the   district  attorney  upon  reviewing  the  available  evidence  determines that the charge  of  a  violation  of  this  section  is  not  warranted,  he  may  consent,  and the court may allow, a disposition by  plea of guilty to another charge is satisfaction of such charge.    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this  subdivision,  in  any  case  wherein  the  charge  laid before the court alleges a violation of  subdivision one of this section by a person who was  under  the  age  of  twenty-one at the time of commission of the offense, the court, with the  consent  of  both  parties, may allow the satisfaction of such charge by  the defendant's agreement to be subject to action  by  the  commissioner  pursuant to section eleven hundred ninety-four-a of this article. In any  such  case,  the  defendant  shall  waive  the  right to a hearing under  section eleven hundred ninety-four-a of this  article  and  such  waiver  shall  have  the  same  force  and effect as a finding of a violation of  section eleven hundred ninety-two-a of  this  article  entered  after  a  hearing conducted pursuant to such section eleven hundred ninety-four-a.  The  defendant  shall  execute  such  waiver  in  open  court,  and,  if  represented by counsel, in the presence of his attorney, on a form to be  provided by the commissioner, which shall be forwarded by the  court  to  the  commissioner within ninety-six hours. To be valid, such form shall,  at a minimum,  contain  clear  and  conspicuous  language  advising  the  defendant that a duly executed waiver: (i) has the same force and effect  as  a  guilty  finding  following  a  hearing pursuant to section eleven  hundred ninety-four-a of this article; (ii) shall subject the  defendant  to  the  imposition of sanctions pursuant to such section eleven hundred  ninety-four-a;  and  (iii)  may  subject  the  defendant  to   increased  sanctions  upon a subsequent violation of this section or section eleven  hundred ninety-two-a of this article. Upon receipt of  a  duly  executed  waiver  pursuant  to  this  paragraph,  the commissioner shall take such  administrative action and impose such sanctions as may  be  required  by  section eleven hundred ninety-four-a of this article.    (d)  In  any  case  wherein the charge laid before the court alleges a  violation of subdivision two-a of  this  section,  any  plea  of  guilty  thereafter  entered in satisfaction of such charge must include at least  a plea of guilty to the violation of the provisions of subdivision  two,  two-a  or  three  of  this  section, and no other disposition by plea of  guilty to any other charge in  satisfaction  of  such  charge  shall  be  authorized;  provided, however, if the district attorney, upon reviewing  the available evidence, determines that the charge  of  a  violation  of  this  section  is  not warranted, such district attorney may consent and  the court may allow a disposition by plea of guilty to another charge in  satisfaction of such charge, provided, however, in all such  cases,  the  court  shall  set  forth upon the record the basis for such disposition.  Provided, further, however, that no such plea shall be accepted  by  the  court  unless  such plea includes as a condition thereof the requirement  that  the  defendant  attend  and  complete   the   alcohol   and   drug  rehabilitation  program  established  pursuant to section eleven hundred  ninety-six of this  article,  including  any  assessment  and  treatment  required thereby; provided, however, that such requirement may be waived  by  the court upon application of the district attorney or the defendant  demonstrating that the defendant, as a condition of the plea,  has  been  required to enter into and complete an alcohol or drug treatment program  prescribed  pursuant  to  an  alcohol  or  substance  abuse screening or  assessment conducted pursuant to section eleven  hundred  ninety-eight-a  of  this  article  or for other good cause shown. The provisions of this  paragraph shall apply, notwithstanding any bars to participation in  the  alcohol  and  drug  rehabilitation  program  set forth in section eleven  hundred ninety-six of this article; provided, however, that  nothing  in  this  paragraph  shall  authorize  the issuance of a conditional license  unless otherwise authorized by law.    11. No person other than an operator of a commercial motor vehicle may  be charged with or convicted of a violation of subdivision five  or  six  of this section.    12.   Driving   while   intoxicated   or  while  ability  impaired  by  drugs--serious physical injury or death or child in the vehicle. (a)  In  every  case  where  a  person is charged with a violation of subdivision  two, two-a, three, four or four-a of this section, the  law  enforcement  officer  alleging  such  charge  shall  make  a  clear  notation  in the  ""Description of Violation"" section of a simplified  traffic  information  (i)  if, arising out of the same incident, someone other than the person  charged was killed or suffered serious physical  injury  as  defined  in  section  10.00 of the penal law; such notation shall be in the form of a  ""D"" if someone other  than  the  person  charged  was  killed  and  such  notation  shall  be  in the form of a ""S.P.I."" if someone other than the  person charged suffered serious physical injury; and  (ii)  if  a  child  aged  fifteen  years  or  less  was present in the vehicle of the person  charged with a violation of  subdivision  two,  two-a,  three,  four  or  four-a  of this section; such notation shall be in the form of ""C.I.V."".  Provided, however, that the failure to make such notations shall  in  no  way  affect  a  charge for a violation of subdivision two, two-a, three,  four or four-a of this section.    (b) Where a law enforcement officer alleges a violation  of  paragraph  (b) of subdivision two-a of this section and the operator of the vehicle  is  a  parent,  guardian,  or  custodian  of,  or  other  person legally  responsible for, a child aged fifteen years or less who is  a  passenger  in  such  vehicle, then the officer shall report or cause a report to be  made,  if applicable, in accordance with title six of article six of the  social services law."

No  person  under  the  age  of  twenty-one  shall  operate a motor vehicle after having consumed alcohol  as defined in this section. For purposes of this section, a person under  the age of twenty-one is deemed to have consumed alcohol  only  if  such  person  has  .02  of one per centum or more but not more than .07 of one  per centum by weight of alcohol in  the  person's  blood,  as  shown  by  chemical  analysis of such person's blood, breath, urine or saliva, made  pursuant to the provisions of section eleven hundred ninety-four of this  article. Any person who operates a motor vehicle in  violation  of  this  section,  and  who is not charged with a violation of any subdivision of  section eleven hundred ninety-two of this article  arising  out  of  the  same  incident  shall  be  referred  to  the  department  for  action in  accordance with the provisions of section eleven  hundred  ninety-four-a  of  this  article.  Except  as otherwise provided in subdivision five of  section eleven hundred ninety-two of this article,  this  section  shall  not  apply  to  a  person  who  operates  a  commercial  motor  vehicle.  Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a finding  that  a  person under the age of twenty-one operated a motor vehicle after having  consumed  alcohol  in  violation  of  this  section is not a judgment of  conviction for a crime or any other offense."

VAT1194,"Vehicle and Traffic      1194. Arrest  and  testing. 1. Arrest and field testing. (a) Arrest.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  section  140.10  of  the  criminal  procedure law, a police officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person,  in  case  of  a  violation  of subdivision one of section eleven hundred  ninety-two of this  article,  if  such  violation  is  coupled  with  an  accident  or  collision  in which such person is involved, which in fact  has been committed, though not in the police  officer's  presence,  when  the  officer  has  reasonable  cause  to  believe that the violation was  committed by such person.    (b) Field testing. Every person operating a motor  vehicle  which  has  been involved in an accident or which is operated in violation of any of  the  provisions  of  this  chapter  shall,  at  the  request of a police  officer, submit to a breath  test  to  be  administered  by  the  police  officer. If such test indicates that such operator has consumed alcohol,  the  police  officer  may  request such operator to submit to a chemical  test in the manner set forth in subdivision two of this section.    2. Chemical tests. (a) When authorized.  Any  person  who  operates  a  motor  vehicle  in this state shall be deemed to have given consent to a  chemical test of one or more of the following: breath, blood, urine,  or  saliva, for the purpose of determining the alcoholic and/or drug content  of  the  blood  provided  that  such  test  is administered by or at the  direction of a police officer with respect to a chemical test of breath,  urine or saliva or, with respect to a chemical test  of  blood,  at  the  direction of a police officer:    (1)  having  reasonable  grounds  to  believe such person to have been  operating in violation of any  subdivision  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two  of  this  article and within two hours after such person has  been placed under arrest for any such violation;  or  having  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  such person to have been operating in violation of  section eleven hundred ninety-two-a of this article and within two hours  after the stop of such person for any such violation,    (2) within two hours after a breath test, as provided in paragraph (b)  of subdivision one of this section,  indicates  that  alcohol  has  been  consumed by such person and in accordance with the rules and regulations  established by the police force of which the officer is a member;    (3)  for  the  purposes  of  this  paragraph,  ""reasonable grounds"" to  believe that a person has been operating a motor  vehicle  after  having  consumed  alcohol in violation of section eleven hundred ninety-two-a of  this  article  shall  be  determined  by   viewing   the   totality   of  circumstances  surrounding  the  incident  which,  when  taken together,  indicate that the operator was driving in violation of such subdivision.  Such circumstances may include any visible or behavioral  indication  of  alcohol  consumption by the operator, the existence of an open container  containing or having contained an alcoholic beverage in  or  around  the  vehicle  driven  by  the operator, or any other evidence surrounding the  circumstances of the incident which indicates that the operator has been  operating a motor vehicle after having consumed alcohol at the  time  of  the incident; or    (4)  notwithstanding  any  other  provision of law to the contrary, no  person under the age of twenty-one shall  be  arrested  for  an  alleged  violation  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two-a  of  this article.  However, a person under the age of twenty-one for whom a  chemical  test  is  authorized pursuant to this paragraph may be temporarily detained by  the police solely for the purpose of requesting  or  administering  such  chemical  test  whenever  arrest  without  a warrant for a petty offense  would be authorized in accordance with the provisions of section  140.10  of  the  criminal  procedure  law or paragraph (a) of subdivision one of  this section.    (b) Report of refusal. (1) If: (A)  such  person  having  been  placed  under  arrest;  or  (B)  after  a  breath test indicates the presence of  alcohol in the person's system; or (C) with regard to a person under the  age of twenty-one, there are reasonable grounds  to  believe  that  such  person  has been operating a motor vehicle after having consumed alcohol  in violation of section eleven hundred ninety-two-a of this article; and  having thereafter been requested to submit to  such  chemical  test  and  having  been  informed  that the person's license or permit to drive and  any non-resident operating privilege shall be immediately suspended  and  subsequently  revoked, or, for operators under the age of twenty-one for  whom there are reasonable grounds to believe that such operator has been  operating a motor vehicle after having consumed alcohol in violation  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two-a of this article, shall be revoked  for refusal to submit to such chemical  test  or  any  portion  thereof,  whether  or  not the person is found guilty of the charge for which such  person is arrested or detained, refuses to submit to such chemical  test  or  any  portion thereof, unless a court order has been granted pursuant  to subdivision three of this section, the test shall not be given and  a  written  report  of such refusal shall be immediately made by the police  officer before whom such refusal was made. Such report may  be  verified  by  having  the  report  sworn  to, or by affixing to such report a form  notice that false statements made therein are punishable as  a  class  A  misdemeanor  pursuant  to  section 210.45 of the penal law and such form  notice together with the subscription of the deponent shall constitute a  verification of the report.    (2) The report of  the  police  officer  shall  set  forth  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  such arrested person or such detained person under  the age of twenty-one had been driving in violation of  any  subdivision  of  section  eleven hundred ninety-two or eleven hundred ninety-two-a of  this article, that said person had refused to submit  to  such  chemical  test,  and  that  no  chemical  test  was  administered  pursuant to the  requirements of subdivision three of this section. The report  shall  be  presented to the court upon arraignment of an arrested person, provided,  however, in the case of a person under the age of twenty-one, for whom a  test  was  authorized  pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph two or  three of paragraph (a) of this subdivision, and who has not been  placed  under  arrest for a violation of any of the provisions of section eleven  hundred ninety-two of this article, such report shall  be  forwarded  to  the  commissioner  within forty-eight hours in a manner to be prescribed  by the commissioner, and  all  subsequent  proceedings  with  regard  to  refusal  to  submit to such chemical test by such person shall be as set  forth in subdivision three of section eleven  hundred  ninety-four-a  of  this article.    (3) For persons placed under arrest for a violation of any subdivision  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two of this article, the license or  permit to drive and any non-resident operating privilege shall, upon the  basis of such written report, be  temporarily  suspended  by  the  court  without  notice  pending  the  determination of a hearing as provided in  paragraph (c) of  this  subdivision.  Copies  of  such  report  must  be  transmitted  by  the  court to the commissioner and such transmittal may  not be waived even with the consent of  all  the  parties.  Such  report  shall  be forwarded to the commissioner within forty-eight hours of such  arraignment.    (4) The court or the police officer, in the case of a person under the  age of twenty-one alleged to be driving after having  consumed  alcohol,  shall  provide such person with a scheduled hearing date, a waiver form,  and such other information as may be required by the commissioner. If  a  hearing,  as  provided  for  in  paragraph  (c)  of this subdivision, or  subdivision three  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-four-a  of  this  article,  is  waived  by such person, the commissioner shall immediately  revoke the license, permit, or non-resident operating privilege,  as  of  the  date of receipt of such waiver in accordance with the provisions of  paragraph (d) of this subdivision.    (c) Hearings. Any person whose license  or  permit  to  drive  or  any  non-resident  driving privilege has been suspended pursuant to paragraph  (b) of this subdivision is entitled to a hearing in  accordance  with  a  hearing   schedule  to  be  promulgated  by  the  commissioner.  If  the  department fails to provide for such hearing fifteen days after the date  of the arraignment of the arrested person, the license, permit to  drive  or  non-resident  operating privilege of such person shall be reinstated  pending a hearing pursuant to this section. The hearing shall be limited  to the following issues: (1) did  the  police  officer  have  reasonable  grounds to believe that such person had been driving in violation of any  subdivision  of  section  eleven hundred ninety-two of this article; (2)  did the police officer make a lawful arrest of such person; (3) was such  person given sufficient warning, in clear or unequivocal language, prior  to such refusal that such refusal to submit to such chemical test or any  portion thereof, would result in the immediate suspension and subsequent  revocation of such person's license or operating  privilege  whether  or  not  such  person is found guilty of the charge for which the arrest was  made; and (4) did such person refuse to submit to such chemical test  or  any portion thereof. If, after such hearing, the hearing officer, acting  on  behalf  of  the commissioner, finds on any one of said issues in the  negative, the hearing officer shall immediately terminate any suspension  arising from such refusal. If, after such hearing, the hearing  officer,  acting  on  behalf  of  the  commissioner finds all of the issues in the  affirmative, such officer shall immediately revoke the license or permit  to drive or any non-resident operating privilege in accordance with  the  provisions  of paragraph (d) of this subdivision. A person who has had a  license or permit to drive or non-resident operating privilege suspended  or revoked pursuant to this subdivision may appeal the findings  of  the  hearing  officer in accordance with the provisions of article three-A of  this chapter. Any person may waive the right to  a  hearing  under  this  section.  Failure  by  such  person  to appear for the scheduled hearing  shall constitute a waiver of such hearing, provided, however, that  such  person  may  petition  the commissioner for a new hearing which shall be  held as soon as practicable.    (d) Sanctions. (1) Revocations. a. Any license which has been  revoked  pursuant  to paragraph (c) of this subdivision shall not be restored for  at least one year after such revocation, nor thereafter, except  in  the  discretion  of  the  commissioner.  However,  no  such  license shall be  restored for  at  least  eighteen  months  after  such  revocation,  nor  thereafter  except  in  the  discretion of the commissioner, in any case  where the person has had a prior revocation resulting  from  refusal  to  submit  to  a  chemical test, or has been convicted of or found to be in  violation of any subdivision of section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two  or  section  eleven  hundred ninety-two-a of this article not arising out of  the same incident, within the five years immediately preceding the  date  of  such  revocation;  provided,  however, a prior finding that a person  under the age of twenty-one has refused to submit  to  a  chemical  test  pursuant to subdivision three of section eleven hundred ninety-four-a of  this  article shall have the same effect as a prior finding of a refusal  pursuant to this subdivision solely for the purpose of  determining  the  length  of  any  license suspension or revocation required to be imposed  under any provision  of  this  article,  provided  that  the  subsequent  offense  or  refusal is committed or occurred prior to the expiration of  the retention period for such prior refusal as set  forth  in  paragraph  (k) of subdivision one of section two hundred one of this chapter.    b.  Any  license  which  has been revoked pursuant to paragraph (c) of  this subdivision or pursuant to  subdivision  three  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-four-a  of  this article, where the holder was under the  age of twenty-one years at the  time  of  such  refusal,  shall  not  be  restored for at least one year, nor thereafter, except in the discretion  of the commissioner. Where such person under the age of twenty-one years  has  a  prior  finding,  conviction  or  youthful  offender adjudication  resulting from a violation  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two  or  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two-a of this article, not arising from  the same incident, such license shall not be restored for at  least  one  year or until such person reaches the age of twenty-one years, whichever  is  the greater period of time, nor thereafter, except in the discretion  of the commissioner.    c. Any commercial driver's license which has been revoked pursuant  to  paragraph  (c)  of  this  subdivision based upon a finding of refusal to  submit to a chemical test, where such finding occurs within  or  outside  of  this state, shall not be restored for at least eighteen months after  such revocation,  nor  thereafter,  except  in  the  discretion  of  the  commissioner,  but  shall not be restored for at least three years after  such revocation,  nor  thereafter,  except  in  the  discretion  of  the  commissioner,  if  the holder of such license was operating a commercial  motor vehicle transporting hazardous  materials  at  the  time  of  such  refusal.  However,  such  person  shall be permanently disqualified from  operating a commercial motor vehicle in any case where the holder has  a  prior  finding  of refusal to submit to a chemical test pursuant to this  section or has a prior conviction of any of the following offenses:  any  violation  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two of this article; any  violation of subdivision one or two  of  section  six  hundred  of  this  chapter;  or has a prior conviction of any felony involving the use of a  motor vehicle pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision  one  of  section  five  hundred  ten-a of this chapter. Provided that the commissioner may  waive such permanent revocation after a period of ten years has  expired  from such revocation provided:    (i) that during such ten year period such person has not been found to  have  refused  a chemical test pursuant to this section and has not been  convicted of any one of the following offenses: any violation of section  eleven hundred ninety-two of  this  article;  refusal  to  submit  to  a  chemical test pursuant to this section; any violation of subdivision one  or two of section six hundred of this chapter; or has a prior conviction  of any felony involving the use of a motor vehicle pursuant to paragraph  (a) of subdivision one of section five hundred ten-a of this chapter;    (ii)  that  such  person  provides  acceptable  documentation  to  the  commissioner that such  person  is  not  in  need  of  alcohol  or  drug  treatment  or  has  satisfactorily completed a prescribed course of such  treatment; and    (iii) after such  documentation  is  accepted,  that  such  person  is  granted  a  certificate  of relief from disabilities or a certificate of  good conduct pursuant to article twenty-three of the correction  law  by  the court in which such person was last penalized.    d.  Upon  a  third  finding of refusal and/or conviction of any of the  offenses  which  require  a  permanent   commercial   driver's   license  revocation,   such  permanent  revocation  may  not  be  waived  by  the  commissioner under any circumstances.    (2) Civil penalties. Except as otherwise provided,  any  person  whose  license,  permit  to  drive,  or any non-resident operating privilege is  revoked pursuant to the provisions of this section shall also be  liable  for a civil penalty in the amount of five hundred dollars except that if  such  revocation  is  a second or subsequent revocation pursuant to this  section issued within a five  year  period,  or  such  person  has  been  convicted  of  a  violation of any subdivision of section eleven hundred  ninety-two of this article within the past five years not arising out of  the same incident, the civil penalty shall be in  the  amount  of  seven  hundred  fifty  dollars. Any person whose license is revoked pursuant to  the provisions of this section based upon a finding of refusal to submit  to a chemical test while operating a commercial motor vehicle shall also  be liable for a civil penalty of five hundred fifty dollars except  that  if such person has previously been found to have refused a chemical test  pursuant  to  this section while operating a commercial motor vehicle or  has a prior conviction of any of the following offenses while  operating  a  commercial  motor  vehicle:  any  violation of section eleven hundred  ninety-two of this article; any violation of subdivision two of  section  six  hundred  of  this  chapter; or has a prior conviction of any felony  involving the use of a commercial motor vehicle  pursuant  to  paragraph  (a)  of  subdivision  one of section five hundred ten-a of this chapter,  then the civil penalty shall be seven  hundred  fifty  dollars.  No  new  driver's  license  or  permit shall be issued, or non-resident operating  privilege restored to such person unless such penalty has been paid. All  penalties collected by the department pursuant to the provisions of this  section shall be the property of the state and shall be  paid  into  the  general fund of the state treasury.    (3)  Effect of rehabilitation program. No period of revocation arising  out of this section may be set aside by the commissioner for the  reason  that   such   person   was   a  participant  in  the  alcohol  and  drug  rehabilitation program set forth in section eleven hundred ninety-six of  this article.    (e) Regulations. The commissioner  shall  promulgate  such  rules  and  regulations  as  may  be  necessary  to  effectuate  the  provisions  of  subdivisions one and two of this section.    (f) Evidence. Evidence of a refusal to submit to such chemical test or  any portion thereof shall be admissible  in  any  trial,  proceeding  or  hearing  based  upon  a  violation  of  the provisions of section eleven  hundred ninety-two of this article but only  upon  a  showing  that  the  person  was given sufficient warning, in clear and unequivocal language,  of the effect of such refusal and  that  the  person  persisted  in  the  refusal.    (g)  Results.  Upon  the  request  of  the  person who was tested, the  results of such test shall be made available to such person.    3. Compulsory  chemical  tests.  (a)  Court  ordered  chemical  tests.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of subdivision two of this section, no  person who operates a motor vehicle in this state may refuse  to  submit  to a chemical test of one or more of the following: breath, blood, urine  or  saliva,  for  the  purpose  of determining the alcoholic and/or drug  content of the blood when a court order for such chemical test has  been  issued in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision.    (b)  When  authorized.  Upon  refusal  by  any  person  to submit to a  chemical test or any portion thereof as described above, the test  shall  not  be given unless a police officer or a district attorney, as defined  in subdivision thirty-two of section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law,  requests and obtains a court order to compel a person  to  submit  to  a  chemical test to determine the alcoholic or drug content of the person's  blood upon a finding of reasonable cause to believe that:    (1)  such person was the operator of a motor vehicle and in the course  of such operation a  person  other  than  the  operator  was  killed  or  suffered  serious  physical  injury  as  defined in section 10.00 of the  penal law; and    (2)  a.  either  such  person operated the vehicle in violation of any  subdivision of section eleven hundred ninety-two of this article, or    b. a breath test administered by a police officer in  accordance  with  paragraph  (b) of subdivision one of this section indicates that alcohol  has been consumed by such person; and    (3) such person has been placed under lawful arrest; and    (4) such person has refused to  submit  to  a  chemical  test  or  any  portion   thereof,  requested  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  paragraph (a) of subdivision two of this section or is  unable  to  give  consent to such a test.    (c)  Reasonable cause; definition. For the purpose of this subdivision  ""reasonable cause"" shall  be  determined  by  viewing  the  totality  of  circumstances  surrounding  the  incident  which,  when  taken together,  indicate that the operator was driving in violation  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two of this article. Such circumstances may include, but  are not limited to: evidence that the operator  was  operating  a  motor  vehicle  in  violation  of  any  provision  of this article or any other  moving violation at the time of the incident; any visible indication  of  alcohol or drug consumption or impairment by the operator; the existence  of  an  open container containing an alcoholic beverage in or around the  vehicle driven by the  operator;  any  other  evidence  surrounding  the  circumstances of the incident which indicates that the operator has been  operating  a  motor vehicle while impaired by the consumption of alcohol  or drugs or intoxicated at the time of the incident.    (d) Court order; procedure. (1) An application for a  court  order  to  compel submission to a chemical test or any portion thereof, may be made  to any supreme court justice, county court judge or district court judge  in  the  judicial  district  in  which  the incident occurred, or if the  incident occurred in the city of  New  York  before  any  supreme  court  justice  or  judge  of  the criminal court of the city of New York. Such  application may be communicated by telephone, radio or  other  means  of  electronic communication, or in person.    (2)  The  applicant  must provide identification by name and title and  must state the purpose of the communication. Upon being advised that  an  application for a court order to compel submission to a chemical test is  being made, the court shall place under oath the applicant and any other  person  providing  information in support of the application as provided  in subparagraph three of this paragraph. After being sworn the applicant  must state that the person from whom the chemical test was requested was  the operator of a motor vehicle and in the course of  such  operation  a  person,  other  than  the operator, has been killed or seriously injured  and, based upon the totality of circumstances, there is reasonable cause  to believe that such person was operating a motor vehicle  in  violation  of  any subdivision of section eleven hundred ninety-two of this article  and, after being placed under  lawful  arrest  such  person  refused  to  submit to a chemical test or any portion thereof, in accordance with the  provisions  of  this section or is unable to give consent to such a test  or any portion thereof. The applicant must make specific allegations  of  fact  to  support  such statement. Any other person properly identified,  may present sworn allegations of fact  in  support  of  the  applicant's  statement.    (3)  Upon  being advised that an oral application for a court order to  compel a person to submit to a chemical test is being made, a  judge  or  justice  shall  place  under  oath  the  applicant  and any other person  providing information in support of the application. Such oath or  oaths  and all of the remaining communication must be recorded, either by means  of  a  voice  recording  device  or  verbatim  stenographic  or verbatim  longhand notes. If a voice recording device is used  or  a  stenographic  record  made, the judge must have the record transcribed, certify to the  accuracy   of  the  transcription  and  file  the  original  record  and  transcription with the court within seventy-two hours of the issuance of  the court order. If the  longhand  notes  are  taken,  the  judge  shall  subscribe  a copy and file it with the court within twenty-four hours of  the issuance of the order.    (4) If the court is satisfied that the requirements for  the  issuance  of  a  court  order  pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this  subdivision have been met, it may grant the  application  and  issue  an  order  requiring  the  accused to submit to a chemical test to determine  the alcoholic  and/or  drug  content  of  his  blood  and  ordering  the  withdrawal  of  a  blood  sample  in  accordance  with the provisions of  paragraph (a) of subdivision four of  this  section.  When  a  judge  or  justice  determines to issue an order to compel submission to a chemical  test based on an oral application, the applicant therefor shall  prepare  the  order  in accordance with the instructions of the judge or justice.  In all cases the order shall include the name of the  issuing  judge  or  justice, the name of the applicant, and the date and time it was issued.  It must be signed by the judge or justice if issued in person, or by the  applicant if issued orally.    (5) Any false statement by an applicant or any other person in support  of  an  application  for  a court order shall subject such person to the  offenses for perjury set forth in article two hundred ten of  the  penal  law.    (6)  The  chief administrator of the courts shall establish a schedule  to provide that a sufficient  number  of  judges  or  justices  will  be  available  in each judicial district to hear oral applications for court  orders as permitted by this section.    (e) Administration  of  compulsory  chemical  test.  An  order  issued  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this subdivision shall require that a  chemical test to determine the alcoholic  and/or  drug  content  of  the  operator's blood must be administered. The provisions of paragraphs (a),  (b)  and  (c) of subdivision four of this section shall be applicable to  any chemical test administered pursuant to this section.    4. Testing procedures.  (a)  Persons  authorized  to  withdraw  blood;  immunity;  testimony.  (1)  At  the  request  of  a  police officer, the  following persons may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining  the  alcoholic  or  drug  content  therein:  (i)  a  physician,  a registered  professional nurse, a registered physician assistant, a certified  nurse  practitioner,  or  an advanced emergency medical technician as certified  by the department of health; or (ii) under the supervision  and  at  the  direction  of  a  physician, registered physician assistant or certified  nurse practitioner acting within his or her lawful scope of practice, or  upon the express consent of the person eighteen years of  age  or  older  from  whom  such  blood  is  to  be  withdrawn:  a  clinical  laboratory  technician or clinical  laboratory  technologist  licensed  pursuant  to  article  one hundred sixty-five of the education law; a phlebotomist; or  a medical laboratory technician or medical technologist  employed  by  a  clinical  laboratory  approved  under  title five of article five of the  public health law. This limitation shall not apply to the  taking  of  a  urine, saliva or breath specimen.    (2)  No person entitled to withdraw blood pursuant to subparagraph one  of this paragraph or  hospital  employing  such  person,  and  no  other  employer of such person shall be sued or held liable for any act done or  omitted  in  the  course of withdrawing blood at the request of a police  officer pursuant to this section.    (3) Any person who may  have  a  cause  of  action  arising  from  the  withdrawal of blood as aforesaid, for which no personal liability exists  under  subparagraph  two  of  this  paragraph,  may maintain such action  against the state if any person entitled to withdraw blood  pursuant  to  paragraph  (a)  hereof acted at the request of a police officer employed  by the state, or against the appropriate political  subdivision  of  the  state  if  such person acted at the request of a police officer employed  by a political subdivision of the state. No action shall  be  maintained  pursuant  to  this  subparagraph unless notice of claim is duly filed or  served in compliance with law.    (4) Notwithstanding the foregoing  provisions  of  this  paragraph  an  action may be maintained by the state or a political subdivision thereof  against a person entitled to withdraw blood pursuant to subparagraph one  of  this  paragraph  or  hospital employing such person for whose act or  omission the state or the political subdivision  has  been  held  liable  under  this  paragraph  to  recover  damages,  not  exceeding the amount  awarded to the claimant, that may have been sustained by  the  state  or  the  political subdivision by reason of gross negligence or bad faith on  the part of such person.    (5) The testimony of any person other than a  physician,  entitled  to  withdraw  blood  pursuant  to  subparagraph  one  of  this paragraph, in  respect to any such withdrawal of blood  made  by  such  person  may  be  received  in  evidence with the same weight, force and effect as if such  withdrawal of blood were made by a physician.    (6) The provisions of  subparagraphs  two,  three  and  four  of  this  paragraph  shall  also  apply  with  regard  to any person employed by a  hospital as security personnel for any act done or omitted in the course  of withdrawing blood at the request of a police officer  pursuant  to  a  court order in accordance with subdivision three of this section.    (b)  Right to additional test. The person tested shall be permitted to  choose a physician to administer a chemical test in addition to the  one  administered at the direction of the police officer.    (c)  Rules  and  regulations. The department of health shall issue and  file rules and regulations approving satisfactory techniques or  methods  of  conducting  chemical  analyses of a person's blood, urine, breath or  saliva and to ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals  to conduct and supervise chemical analyses of a person's  blood,  urine,  breath  or saliva. If the analyses were made by an individual possessing  a permit issued by the department of health, this shall  be  presumptive  evidence that the examination was properly given. The provisions of this  paragraph  do  not  prohibit the introduction as evidence of an analysis  made by an individual other than a person possessing a permit issued  by  the department of health."
VAT1194-A,"Vehicle and Traffic      1194-a. Driving  after  having  consumed  alcohol; under twenty-one;  procedure. 1. Chemical test report and hearing.  (a) Whenever a chemical  test of the breath, blood, urine or saliva of an operator who  is  under  the  age  of  twenty-one indicates that such person has operated a motor  vehicle in violation of section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two-a  of  this  article,  and  such person is not charged with violating any subdivision  of section eleven hundred ninety-two arising out of the  same  incident,  the  police  officer who administered the test shall forward a report of  the results of such test to the department within twenty-four  hours  of  the  time  when such results are available in a manner prescribed by the  commissioner, and the operator  shall  be  given  a  hearing  notice  as  provided  in  subdivision  one-a  of  this  section,  to appear before a  hearing officer in the county where the chemical test was  administered,  or  in an adjoining county under such circumstances as prescribed by the  commissioner, on a date to be established in accordance with a  schedule  promulgated  by the commissioner. Such hearing shall occur within thirty  days of, but not less than forty-eight hours from,  the  date  that  the  chemical   test   was   administered,   provided,   however,  where  the  commissioner determines, based upon the availability of hearing officers  and the anticipated volume of hearings at a  particular  location,  that  the  scheduling  of  such  hearing  within  thirty days would impair the  timely scheduling or conducting  of  other  hearings  pursuant  to  this  chapter,  such  hearing  shall be scheduled at the next hearing date for  such particular location. When providing the operator with such  hearing  notice,  the  police officer shall also give to the operator, and shall,  prior to the commencement of the hearing,  provide  to  the  department,  copies  of  the  following reports, documents and materials: any written  report  or  document,  or  portion  thereof,   concerning   a   physical  examination,  a scientific test or experiment, including the most recent  record  of  inspection,  or  calibration  or  repair  of   machines   or  instruments utilized to perform such scientific tests or experiments and  the  certification  certificate,  if  any,  held  by the operator of the  machine or instrument, which tests or examinations were made  by  or  at  the  request or direction of a public servant engaged in law enforcement  activity. The report of the police officer shall be verified  by  having  the  report  sworn  to, or by affixing to such report a form notice that  false statements made therein are punishable as a  class  A  misdemeanor  pursuant  to  section  210.45  of  the  penal  law  and such form notice  together  with  the  subscription  of  the  deponent  shall   constitute  verification of the report.    (b)  Every  person  under the age of twenty-one who is alleged to have  operated a motor vehicle after having consumed alcohol as set  forth  in  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two-a  of  this article, and who is not  charged  with  violating  any  subdivision  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two of this article arising out of the same incident, is entitled  to  a hearing before a hearing officer in accordance with the provisions  of this section. Unless otherwise provided by law, the license or permit  to drive or any non-resident operating privilege of  such  person  shall  not  be  suspended  or  revoked  prior  to  the  scheduled date for such  hearing.    (i) The hearing shall be limited to the following  issues:    (1)  did  such person operate the motor vehicle; (2) was a valid request to submit  to  a  chemical  test  made by the police officer in accordance with the  provisions of section eleven hundred ninety-four of  this  article;  (3)  was  such  person  less  than  twenty-one  years  of  age at the time of  operation of the motor vehicle;  (4)  was  the  chemical  test  properly  administered in accordance with the provisions of section eleven hundred  ninety-four  of this article; (5) did the test find that such person had  driven after having  consumed  alcohol  as  defined  in  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two-a  of  this  article; and (6) did the police officer  make a lawful stop of such person. The burden of proof shall be  on  the  police  officer  to  prove  each of these issues by clear and convincing  evidence.    (ii) Every person who is  entitled  to  a  hearing  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  has the right to be present at the hearing; the right to be  represented by attorney, or in the hearing officer's discretion, by  any  other  person  the  operator  chooses;  the  right to receive and review  discovery materials as provided in this subdivision; the  right  not  to  testify;  the right to present evidence and witnesses in his own behalf,  the right to cross examine adverse witnesses, and the  right  to  appeal  from an adverse determination in accordance with article three-A of this  chapter.  Any  person  representing  the  operator  must  conform to the  standards of  conduct  required  of  attorneys  appearing  before  state  courts,  and  failure  to conform to these standards will be grounds for  declining to permit his continued appearance in the hearing.    (iii) Hearings conducted pursuant to  this  subdivision  shall  be  in  accordance  with  this subdivision and with the provisions applicable to  the adjudication  of  traffic  infractions  pursuant  to  the  following  provisions  of  part  124  of  title  fifteen  of  the  codes, rules and  regulations of the state of New York: paragraph  (b)  of  section  124.1  regarding   the  opening  statement;  paragraph  (b)  of  section  124.2  regarding  the  right  to  representation  and  to  remain  silent   and  paragraphs (a) through (e) of section 124.4 regarding the conduct of the  hearing,   procedure   and  recusal;  provided,  however,  that  nothing  contained in this subparagraph shall be deemed  to  preclude  a  hearing  officer  from changing the order of a hearing conducted pursuant to this  subdivision as justice may require and for good cause shown.    (iv) The rules governing receipt of evidence in a court of  law  shall  not  apply in a hearing conducted pursuant to this subdivision except as  follows:    (1) on the merits of the charge, and whether or not a  party  objects,  the  hearing  officer  shall exclude from consideration the following: a  privileged communication; evidence which,  for  constitutional  reasons,  would not be admissible in a court of law; evidence of prior misconduct,  incompetency  or illness, except where such evidence would be admissible  in a court of law; evidence which is irrelevant or immaterial;    (2)  no  negative  inference  shall  be  drawn  from  the   operator's  exercising the right not to testify.    (v)  If,  after such hearing, the hearing officer, acting on behalf of  the commissioner, finds all of the issues set forth in this  subdivision  in  the  affirmative,  the  hearing  officer shall suspend or revoke the  license or permit to drive or non-resident operating privilege  of  such  person  in accordance with the time periods set forth in subdivision two  of section eleven hundred ninety-three of this article. If,  after  such  hearing,  the  hearing  officer,  acting  on behalf of the commissioner,  finds any of said issues in the negative, the hearing officer must  find  that the operator did not drive after having consumed alcohol.    (vi) A person who has had a license or permit to drive or non-resident  operating  privilege  suspended or revoked pursuant to the provisions of  this section may appeal the finding of the hearing officer in accordance  with the provisions of article three-A of this chapter.    (c) Unless an adjournment of the hearing date has been  granted,  upon  the   operator's   failure  to  appear  for  a  scheduled  hearing,  the  commissioner  shall  suspend  the  license  or  permit   to   drive   or  non-resident  operating  privilege  until  the  operator  petitions  the  commissioner and a rescheduled hearing is conducted, provided,  however,  the  commissioner shall restore such person's license or permit to drive  or non-resident operating  privilege  if  such  rescheduled  hearing  is  adjourned  at  the request of a person other than the operator. Requests  for  adjournments  shall  be  made  and  determined  in  accordance with  regulations promulgated by the commissioner. If such a  request  by  the  operator  for  an  adjournment is granted, the commissioner shall notify  the operator of the rescheduled hearing, which shall  be  scheduled  for  the next hearing date. If a second or subsequent request by the operator  for an adjournment is granted, the operator's license or permit to drive  or non-resident operating privilege may be suspended pending the hearing  at  the  time  such  adjournment is granted; provided, however, that the  records of the department or the  evidence  already  admitted  furnishes  reasonable  grounds  to  believe such suspension is necessary to prevent  continuing violations  or  a  substantial  traffic  safety  hazard;  and  provided  further,  that  such  hearing  shall be scheduled for the next  hearing date.    If a police officer does not appear for a hearing, the hearing officer  shall have the authority to dismiss the charge. Any person may waive the  right to a  hearing  under  this  subdivision,  in  a  form  and  manner  prescribed  by the commissioner, and may enter an admission of guilt, in  person or by mail, to  the  charge  of  operating  a  motor  vehicle  in  violation  of  section eleven hundred ninety-two-a of this article. Such  admission of guilt shall have the same force and effect as a finding  of  guilt   entered   following   a   hearing  conducted  pursuant  to  this  subdivision.    1-a. Hearing notice. The hearing notice issued to an operator pursuant  to subdivision one of this section shall be in a form as  prescribed  by  the  commissioner.  In addition to containing information concerning the  time, date and location of the hearing, and such  other  information  as  the  commissioner  deems  appropriate,  such  hearing  notice shall also  contain the following information: the  date,  time  and  place  of  the  offense  charged;  the  procedures  for  requesting  an adjournment of a  scheduled hearing as provided in this section, the operator's right to a  hearing conducted pursuant to this section and the right to  waive  such  hearing  and  plead  guilty, either in person or by mail, to the offense  charged.    2. Civil penalty. Unless otherwise provided, any person whose license,  permit to drive, or any non-resident operating privilege is suspended or  revoked pursuant to the provisions of this section shall also be  liable  for  a  civil  penalty in the amount of one hundred twenty-five dollars,  which  shall  be  distributed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  subdivision nine of section eighteen hundred three of this chapter.    3.  Refusal  report  and  hearing.  (a)  Any  person  under the age of  twenty-one who is suspected of operating a motor  vehicle  after  having  consumed  alcohol in violation of section eleven hundred ninety-two-a of  this chapter, and who is not charged with violating any  subdivision  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two  of this article arising out of the  same incident, and who has been requested to submit to a  chemical  test  pursuant  to  paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section eleven hundred  ninety-four of this article and after  having  been  informed  that  his  license  or  permit  to  drive  and any non-resident operating privilege  shall be revoked for refusal to submit to  such  chemical  test  or  any  portion  thereof,  whether  or  not  there is a finding of driving after  having consumed alcohol, and such  person  refuses  to  submit  to  such  chemical  test or any portion thereof, shall be entitled to a hearing in  accordance with a schedule promulgated by  the  commissioner,  and  such  hearing shall occur within thirty days of, but not less than forty-eight  hours  from,  the  date  of  such  refusal, provided, however, where the  commissioner determines, based upon the availability of hearing officers  and the anticipated volume of hearings at a  particular  location,  that  the  scheduling  of  such  hearing  within  thirty days would impair the  timely  scheduling  or  conducting  of  other  hearings pursuant to this  chapter, such hearing shall be scheduled at the next  hearing  date  for  such particular location.    (b)  Unless  an adjournment of the hearing date has been granted, upon  the  operator's  failure  to  appear  for  a  scheduled   hearing,   the  commissioner   shall   suspend   the  license  or  permit  to  drive  or  non-resident  operating  privilege  until  the  operator  petitions  the  commissioner  and a rescheduled hearing is conducted, provided, however,  the commissioner shall restore such person's license or permit to  drive  or  non-resident  operating  privilege  if  such  rescheduled hearing is  adjourned at the request of a person other than the  operator.  Requests  for  adjournments  shall  be  made  and  determined  in  accordance with  regulations promulgated by the commissioner. If such a  request  by  the  operator  for  an  adjournment is granted, the commissioner shall notify  the operator of the rescheduled hearing, which shall  be  scheduled  for  the next hearing date. If a second or subsequent request by the operator  for an adjournment is granted, the operator's license or permit to drive  or non-resident operating privilege may be suspended pending the hearing  at  the  time  such  adjournment is granted; provided, however, that the  records of the department or the  evidence  already  admitted  furnishes  reasonable  grounds  to  believe such suspension is necessary to prevent  continuing violations  or  a  substantial  traffic  safety  hazard;  and  provided  further,  that  such  hearing  shall be scheduled for the next  hearing date.

No person  shall be required to attend or participate in such program or any aspect  thereof  for  a  period  exceeding  eight   months   except   upon   the  recommendation of the department of mental hygiene or appropriate health  officials administering the program on behalf of a municipality.    2.  Curriculum.  The  form,  content and method of presentation of the  various  aspects  of  such  program  shall   be   established   by   the  commissioner.

Where available. A course in such program shall be available in at  least  every  county  in  the  state,  except  where  the   commissioner  determines  that  there  is  not  a  sufficient  number  of  alcohol  or  drug-related traffic offenses in a county to mandate  the  establishment  of  said  course,  and that provisions be made for the residents of said  county to attend a course in another county where a course exists.    4. Eligibility. Participation in the program shall be limited to those  persons convicted of alcohol or drug-related traffic offenses or persons  who have been adjudicated youthful offenders for alcohol or drug-related  traffic offenses, or persons  found  to  have  been  operating  a  motor  vehicle  after  having  consumed  alcohol in violation of section eleven  hundred ninety-two-a of this article, who choose to participate and  who  satisfy  the  criteria  and  meet  the requirements for participation as  established by this section and the regulations promulgated  thereunder;  provided,  however,  in  the  exercise of discretion, the judge imposing  sentence may prohibit the defendant from enrolling in such program.  The  commissioner  or  deputy  may  exercise discretion, to reject any person  from participation referred to such program and nothing herein contained  shall be construed as creating a right to be included in any  course  or  program  established under this section. In addition, no person shall be  permitted to take part  in  such  program  if,  during  the  five  years  immediately  preceding  commission of an alcohol or drug-related traffic  offense  or  a  finding  of  a  violation  of  section  eleven   hundred  ninety-two-a  of this article, such person has participated in a program  established pursuant to this article or been convicted of a violation of  any subdivision of section eleven hundred  ninety-two  of  this  article  other  than  a  violation  committed  prior  to November first, nineteen  hundred eighty-eight, for which such person did not participate in  such  program.

Effect  of  completion. Except as provided in subparagraph nine of  paragraph (b) of subdivision two of section eleven hundred  ninety-three  or  in subparagraph three of paragraph (d) of subdivision two of section  eleven hundred ninety-four of this article, upon  successful  completion  of  a  course  in  such  program  as  certified  by its administrator, a  participant may apply to the commissioner on a form  provided  for  that  purpose,  for  the  termination  of  the  suspension or revocation order  issued as a result of the  participant's  conviction  which  caused  the  participation  in  such  course.  In  the  exercise  of discretion, upon  receipt of such application, and upon payment of any civil penalties for  which the applicant may be liable, the  commissioner  is  authorized  to  terminate  such  order or orders and return the participant's license or  reinstate the privilege of operating a  motor  vehicle  in  this  state.  However,  the  commissioner  shall not issue any new license nor restore  any license where said issuance of restoral is prohibited by subdivision  two of section eleven hundred ninety-three of this article.    6. Fees. The commissioner shall establish a schedule  of  fees  to  be  paid  by  or on behalf of each participant in the program, and may, from  time to time, modify same.

Provided, however, that pursuant to an agreement with  the department a municipality, department thereof, or other  agency  may  conduct a course in such program with all or part of the expense of such  course  and  program  being  borne  by  such municipality, department or  agency.

In the event  of such revocation, the fee described in subdivision six of this section  shall not be refunded.    (f) It shall be a traffic infraction for the holder of  a  conditional  license  or  privilege  to operate a motor vehicle upon a public highway  for any use other than those authorized pursuant  to  paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision.  When  a  person  is  convicted  of this offense, the  sentence of the court must be a  fine  of  not  less  than  two  hundred  dollars  nor more than five hundred dollars or a term of imprisonment of  not  more  than  fifteen  days  or  both  such  fine  and  imprisonment.  Additionally,  the  conditional  license or privileges described in this  subdivision  shall  be  revoked  by  the  commissioner  upon   receiving  notification  from  the court that the holder thereof has been convicted  of this offense.    (g)  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary   contained   in   a  certificate of relief from disabilities or a certificate of good conduct  issued  pursuant  to  article  twenty-three  of  the correction law, any  conditional license or privilege issued  to  a  person  convicted  of  a  violation  of  any  subdivision  of section eleven hundred ninety-two of  this article shall not be valid for  the  operation  of  any  commercial  motor  vehicle.  In  addition,  no such conditional license or privilege  shall be valid for the  operation  of  a  taxicab  as  defined  in  this  chapter.    (h)  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent provision of this chapter, the  conditional license described  in  this  subdivision  may,  pursuant  to  regulations established by the commissioner, be issued to a person whose  license  has been suspended pending prosecution pursuant to subparagraph  seven of paragraph (e) of subdivision  two  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-three of this article."

The provisions of this section shall apply  throughout  the  state  to each person required or otherwise ordered by a court as a  condition of probation or conditional discharge to install  and  operate  an  ignition  interlock  device  in  any vehicle which he or she owns or  operates.    2. Requirements. (a) In addition to any other penalties prescribed  by  law, the court shall require that any person who has been convicted of a  violation  of  subdivision two, two-a or three of section eleven hundred  ninety-two of this article, or any crime defined by this chapter or  the  penal  law  of  which  an  alcohol-related violation of any provision of  section eleven hundred  ninety-two  of  this  article  is  an  essential  element,  to  install  and  maintain,  as  a  condition  of probation or  conditional  discharge,  a  functioning  ignition  interlock  device  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of this section and, as applicable, in  accordance with the provisions of subdivisions one and one-a of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-three  of  this  article; provided, however, the  court may not authorize the operation of a motor vehicle by  any  person  whose  license  or privilege to operate a motor vehicle has been revoked  except as provided herein. For any such individual subject to a sentence  of probation, installation and maintenance of  such  ignition  interlock  device shall be a condition of probation.    (b)  Nothing  contained  in  this section shall prohibit a court, upon  application by a probation department, from modifying the conditions  of  probation  of  any  person  convicted  of  any  violation  set  forth in  paragraph (a) of this subdivision prior to the effective  date  of  this  section,  to  require  the installation and maintenance of a functioning  ignition interlock device, and such person shall thereafter  be  subject  to the provisions of this section.    (c)  Nothing  contained  in  this  section  shall authorize a court to  sentence any person to a period of probation  or  conditional  discharge  for  the  purpose  of  subjecting  such person to the provisions of this  section, unless such person would have otherwise been so eligible for  a  sentence of probation or conditional discharge.    3.

No  such  request  shall  be  made  nor shall such a license be granted,  however, if such person has been found by a court to  have  committed  a  violation  of  section  five  hundred  eleven of this chapter during the  license revocation period or deemed by a  court  to  have  violated  any  condition  of  probation or conditional discharge set forth by the court  relating to the operation of a  motor  vehicle  or  the  consumption  of  alcohol.  In  exercising  discretion  relating  to  the  issuance  of  a  post-revocation conditional license pursuant to  this  subdivision,  the  commissioner  shall  not deny such issuance based solely upon the number  of convictions for violations  of  any  subdivision  of  section  eleven  hundred  ninety-two  of this article committed by such person within the  ten years prior to application for such license.

Good cause may include a  finding that the person is not the owner of  a  motor  vehicle  if  such  person asserts under oath that such person is not the owner of any motor  vehicle and that he or she will not operate any motor vehicle during the  period  of  interlock  restriction except as may be otherwise authorized  pursuant to law. ""Owner"" shall have the  same  meaning  as  provided  in  section one hundred twenty-eight of this chapter.

In the event of such  waiver, the cost of  the  device  shall  be  borne  in  accordance  with  regulations  issued  under  paragraph  (g) of subdivision one of section  eleven hundred ninety-three of this article or pursuant  to  such  other  agreement  as may be entered into for provision of the device. Such cost  shall be considered a fine for  the  purposes  of  subdivision  five  of  section  420.10  of  the  criminal  procedure  law.  Such cost shall not  replace, but shall instead be in addition to, any fines, surcharges,  or  other costs imposed pursuant to this chapter or other applicable laws.

Such standards shall include provisions for  setting a minimum and maximum calibration range and shall  include,  but  not be limited to, requirements that the devices:    (1)  have  features  that make circumventing difficult and that do not  interfere with the normal or safe operation of the vehicle;    (2) work accurately and reliably in an unsupervised environment;    (3) resist tampering and give evidence if tampering is attempted;    (4) minimize inconvenience to a sober user;    (5) require a proper, deep,  lung  breath  sample  or  other  accurate  measure of blood alcohol content equivalence;    (6) operate reliably over the range of automobile environments;    (7)  correlate  well with permissible levels of alcohol consumption as  may be established by the sentencing court or by any provision  of  law;  and    (8)   are  manufactured  by  a  party  covered  by  product  liability  insurance.    (c)  The  commissioner  of  the  department  of  health  may,  in  his  discretion,  adopt  in  whole  or  relevant part, the guidelines, rules,  regulations, studies, or independent laboratory tests performed  on  and  relied  upon  for  the  certification  or approval of ignition interlock  devices by other states, their agencies or commissions.    7.  Use  of other vehicles. (a) Any requirement of this article or the  penal law that a person operate a vehicle only if it is equipped with an  ignition interlock device shall apply to every motor vehicle operated by  that person including, but not limited to,  vehicles  that  are  leased,  rented or loaned.    (b)  No person shall knowingly rent, lease, or lend a motor vehicle to  a person known to have had his or her driving  privilege  restricted  to  vehicles  equipped  with an ignition interlock device unless the vehicle  is so equipped.

(c) A violation of paragraph (a) or (b) of this subdivision shall be a  misdemeanor.    8. Employer vehicle. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one  and paragraph (d) of subdivision nine of this section, if  a  person  is  required  to  operate a motor vehicle owned by said person's employer in  the course and scope of his or her employment, the  person  may  operate  that  vehicle  without  installation  of  an approved ignition interlock  device only in the course and scope of such employment and only  if  the  employer  has been notified that the person's driving privilege has been  restricted under the provisions of this article or the penal law and the  person whose privilege has been so restricted has provided the court and  probation department with written documentation indicating the  employer  has  knowledge of the restriction imposed and has granted permission for  the person to operate the employer's vehicle without the device only for  business purposes. The person shall notify the court and  the  probation  department of his or her intention to so operate the employer's vehicle.  A  motor vehicle owned by a business entity which business entity is all  or partly owned or controlled by  a  person  otherwise  subject  to  the  provisions of this article or the penal law is not a motor vehicle owned  by  the  employer  for  purposes  of  the  exemption  provided  in  this  subdivision. The provisions of this subdivision shall apply only to  the  operation of such vehicle in the scope of such employment.    9.  Circumvention  of  interlock  device.  (a) No person whose driving  privilege is restricted pursuant to this article or the penal law  shall  request,  solicit  or  allow  any  other person to blow into an ignition  interlock device, or to start a motor vehicle equipped with the  device,  for  the  purpose of providing the person so restricted with an operable  motor vehicle.    (b) No person shall blow into an ignition interlock device or start  a  motor  vehicle  equipped with the device for the purpose of providing an  operable motor vehicle  to  a  person  whose  driving  privilege  is  so  restricted.    (c)  No  person  shall tamper with or circumvent an otherwise operable  ignition interlock device.    (d) No person subject to a court  ordered  ignition  interlock  device  shall operate a motor vehicle without such device.    (e)  In  addition to any other provisions of law, any person convicted  of a violation of paragraph (a), (b), (c), or (d)  of  this  subdivision  shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.    10.  Warning  label.  The  department of health shall design a warning  label which the manufacturer shall  affix  to  each  ignition  interlock  device upon installation in the state. The label shall contain a warning  that  any  person  tampering,  circumventing,  or otherwise misusing the  device is guilty of a misdemeanor and may be subject to civil liability.    * NB Repealed September 1, 2015"

Such  exclusion shall not be construed to prevent the delivery  or  pickup  of  merchandise  or  other  property  along  the  highways  from  which such  vehicles or combinations are otherwise excluded.    21. Serve notice of a violation of  any  provision  of  local  law  or  ordinance  relating  to  the  prevention of noise pollution caused by an  audible motor vehicle burglar alarm and over which the city  or  village  has  jurisdiction  upon  the  owner  of a motor vehicle by affixing such  notice to said vehicle in a conspicuous place.    22.

(d)  Each  such  legislative  body  of a city or a village shall cause  signs to be erected to inform persons of the  legal  overhead  clearance  for  all  bridges and structures on highways under its jurisdiction. The  legal clearance shall be one foot less than the measured clearance.

On  bridges  or  structures  having  fourteen  feet  or more of measured  clearance, no such signs shall be required.    (e) No legislative body of a city or a village  shall  enact  any  law  that prohibits the use of sidewalks by persons with disabilities who use  either a wheelchair or an electrically-driven mobility assistance device  being operated or driven by such person."

The  party which erected such signals shall pay the state an annual fee to be  determined  by the commissioner of transportation. Such fees shall cover  the cost of normal signal maintenance, but shall not include the cost of  electrical energy or major modifications  or  replacements  which  shall  remain  the  responsibility  of  the party which erected the signal. The  department of transportation may, in its discretion, agree to assume the  same maintenance responsibility for signals erected with the  permission  of  the  department  of  transportation prior to the first day of April,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-six,  if  the  department  of   transportation  determines  that  such  signal substantially meets established standards  and is in a satisfactory state of repair. The party which  erected  such  signals shall also pay the state an annual fee which shall be calculated  in the same manner as fees for signals erected on or after the first day  of April, nineteen hundred eighty-six.    No  such  traffic signal or flashing signal erected with permission of  the department of  transportation  shall  be  removed  except  with  the  written consent of the department of transportation.

The renewal or transfer of the old  certificate  of  registration,  properly signed by the previous owner, shall constitute a  temporary registration for such new owner for a period determined by the  commissioner from the date such snowmobile was transferred  to  the  new  owner. In the event that such snowmobile was purchased from a registered  dealer,  the  application  must  be  accompanied  by  a  dealer's  form,  numbered, completed and signed by the dealer or his agent and signed  by  the new owner, as prescribed by the commissioner.    5.

Issuance and period of validity. The commissioner is authorized  to  register  a vessel, issue a registration certificate, validation sticker  or stickers and assign a registration  number  to  such  vessel.

Every person operating a vessel shall, upon demand of any peace officer,  federal officer or other person having  the  authority  to  enforce  the  provisions  of this chapter, produce the certificate of registration for  inspection. The failure to produce the certificate of  registration,  as  provided  herein,  shall  not  be  an  offense, but shall be presumptive  evidence of operating a vessel which is not registered  as  required  by  this article.    3. Registration number. A registration number once assigned under this  section  shall  remain  with  the  vessel until the vessel is destroyed,  abandoned or permanently removed from the state,  or  until  changed  or  terminated  by the commissioner. The registration number assigned to the  vessel shall be painted on or attached to each side of the forward  half  of  the  vessel  by the owner in such a position as to be displayed in a  conspicuous manner with figures and letters at  least  three  inches  in  height.  The  registration  number  shall  be  maintained  in  a legible  condition so that the figures and letters are readily discernible during  daylight hours at a distance of one hundred feet. No other number  shall  be  carried  on  the  forward  half  of such vessel. Notwithstanding the  foregoing provisions of this subdivision, a vessel having a valid marine  document issued by the United States or a foreign government  shall  not  be required to display its assigned registration number on the vessel.    4.  Validating  stickers.  Effective  April  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-six, at the time of the original registration and at the time  of  each  renewal  thereof,  the  commissioner  shall  also  issue  to  said  registrant a validating sticker or stickers indicating the  validity  of  the   current  registration  and  the  expiration  date  thereof,  which  validating sticker or stickers shall be affixed to the  vessel  in  such  manner  as  the commissioner may prescribe provided, however, that where  the hull of a vessel equipped with a windshield is constructed of  wood,  such  validating sticker or stickers may be affixed to the windshield of  the vessel. From that time and notwithstanding the fact  that  a  vessel  has  been  assigned a registration number, it shall not be considered as  validly  registered  within  the  meaning  of  this  article  unless   a  validating  sticker  and  current  registration  certificate  have  been  issued. In addition, the commissioner may issue a validating sticker  or  stickers  to the holder of a certificate of registration issued prior to  April first, nineteen hundred eighty-six, without further expense to the  holder, indicating the validity of  the  current  registration  and  the  expiration  date  thereof, which validating sticker or stickers shall be  affixed to  the  vessel  in  such  a  manner  as  the  commissioner  may  prescribe. The commissioner shall establish by regulation such terms and  conditions  as  may  be  necessary  to  accomplish  the issuance of such  validating sticker or stickers and the date upon  which  their  issuance  shall be completed. From thirty days after such date and notwithstanding  the fact that a vessel has been assigned a registration number and has a  current  certificate  of  registration,  it  shall  not be considered as  validly  registered  within  the  meaning  of  this  article  unless   a  validating sticker or stickers is displayed on the vessel."
VAT2254,"Vehicle and Traffic      2254. Registration record. Upon the issuance of a registration for a  vessel,  as  provided in this article, the commissioner shall enter upon  the records of the department the registration of such vessel under  the  registration number assigned to such vessel as provided in this article,  and in any other manner which he deems appropriate."
VAT2255,"Vehicle and Traffic      2255. Temporary registration. A temporary registration may be issued  by a dealer registered in accordance with the provisions of this article  to  the  purchaser  of  a  vessel sold by the dealer provided the dealer  makes application on behalf  of  the  owner  for  a  registration  under  section  twenty-two hundred fifty-one of this article no later than five  calendar days after the issuance of  the  temporary  registration.  Such  temporary  registration shall be valid, if issued and used in accordance  with regulations promulgated by the commissioner, for the  operation  of  the  vessel  for  which  it  is issued for thirty days after the date of  issuance.  Such  temporary  registration  may   be   extended   by   the  commissioner  for  an  additional  thirty  days.  The commissioner shall  provide registered boat dealers with documents and forms to be  used  in  the issuance of such temporary registrations."

Such  suspension or revocation shall be ordered only after a  hearing,  unless  waived. However, the commissioner may temporarily suspend a registration  pending a hearing.    2.

VAT2257,"Vehicle and Traffic      2257. Registration  of dealers. 1. For the purposes of this article,  a dealer shall be any person engaged in the business of buying,  selling  or trading vessels.  A person who sells three or more vessels for profit  within  one  calendar  year  shall  be  presumed  to be a dealer if such  vessels were purchased, acquired or otherwise obtained  by  such  person  for the purpose of resale, and were never placed in his consumer use. On  and  after  April  first,  nineteen  hundred eighty-six, no person shall  engage in business as a dealer, or represent or  advertise  that  he  is  engaged,  or  intends  to engage, in such business in this state, unless  there shall have been issued to him a  certificate  of  registration  as  provided  in  this  section.  A  person  shall  not  be  required  to be  registered as a dealer  if  he  sells  no  vessels  other  than  vessels  determined  by  regulation  of the commissioner to be vessels or devices  which would not ordinarily be considered as usable for transportation on  water.    2.  Application  for  registration.  Every  dealer   shall   file   an  application  for registration as a dealer with the commissioner of motor  vehicles, together with all required fees, in such form and  detail  and  containing   such  information  as  the  commissioner  shall  reasonably  prescribe.    3.  Issuance  of  certificate.  If  the  commissioner   approves   the  application,  he  shall issue a certificate of registration in such form  as he may prescribe.

(a) Upon payment of  the  required  fee,  a  dealer  shall be entitled to receive one or more  demonstrator numbers, which may be used in lieu of a registration issued  under section twenty-two hundred  fifty-one  of  this  article  for  the  operation  of  any vessel owned or controlled by the registrant and held  for sale or demonstration. Demonstrator numbers shall be displayed in  a  manner prescribed by the commissioner.    (b)  Upon  payment  of the required fee, a dealer shall be entitled to  receive one or more number plates which may  be  used  in  lieu  of  any  registration  issued  under section four hundred one of this chapter for  the operation of any boat trailer owned or controlled by the dealer  and  held  for  the purpose of sale or demonstration, provided such operation  is directly related to the sale or demonstration of any boat trailer  or  vessel.  The provisions of section four hundred two of this chapter with  respect to the care and display of number plates shall apply  to  number  plates issued under this subdivision.    (c)  The  commissioner  may,  in  his  discretion, limit the number of  demonstrator numbers or number plates  which  shall  be  issued  to  any  registrant. The fee for the replacement of lost, mutilated, or destroyed  demonstrator numbers or number plates shall be two dollars.    5. Fees.

The  triennial  fee  for  demonstrator numbers or number plates shall be sixty  dollars  for  each  number  or  number plate. The application for registration, demonstrator  numbers and number plates shall be accompanied  by  the  required  fees.  There  shall  be  no  refund  of  any  registration  fee  or any fee for  demonstrator numbers or number plates.    6.

The  commissioner   may,   in   his  discretion,  require  a  registrant to maintain a record in a prescribed  form of all vessels received or disposed of by him. Upon request  of  an  agent of the commissioner or of any peace officer acting pursuant to his  special  duties, a registrant shall produce such records and permit said  agent or peace officer to examine them, and any vessels on the  premises  subject  to the record keeping requirements of this section during usual  business hours or while  the  registrant  is  conducting  business.  The  failure to produce such records or to permit such inspection as required  by this subdivision shall be a violation."

In  lieu of suspending or revoking the certificate of registration  of a dealer, the commissioner may, for any of the grounds  specified  in  subdivision  one  of  this section, suspend the authority of a dealer to  issue temporary registrations pursuant  to  section  twenty-two  hundred  fifty-five of this article.    3. Civil penalty. The commissioner, or any person deputized by him, in  addition  to  or  in  lieu  of revoking or suspending the certificate of  registration, or in  addition  to  suspending  the  authority  to  issue  temporary  registrations, may in any one proceeding by order require the  registrant to pay to the people of this state a penalty  in  a  sum  not  exceeding  one  thousand dollars for each violation and upon the failure  of such registrant to pay such penalty  within  twenty  days  after  the  mailing of such order, postage prepaid, registered, and addressed to the  last  known  place  of business of such registrant, unless such order is  stayed  by  an  order  of  a  court  of  competent   jurisdiction,   the  commissioner  may  suspend  the  certificate  of  registration  of  such  registrant until such penalty is paid. Civil  penalties  assessed  under  this  subdivision shall be paid to the commissioner for deposit into the  state treasury, and unpaid civil  penalties  may  be  recovered  by  the  commissioner  in  a  civil  action  in  the name of the commissioner. In  addition, as an alternative to such civil action and  provided  that  no  proceeding  for  judicial  review shall then be pending and the time for  initiation of such proceeding shall have expired, the  commissioner  may  file  with  the  county  clerk  of the county in which the registrant is  located a final order of the commissioner containing the amount  of  the  penalty  assessed.  The  filing  of such final order shall have the full  force and effect of a judgment duly docketed in the office of such clerk  and may be enforced in the same manner and with the same effect as  that  provided  by  law  in respect to executions issued against property upon  judgment of a court of record.    4. No certificate of registration, demonstrator number or number plate  shall be suspended or revoked, civil penalty  imposed  or  authority  to  issue temporary registrations suspended until such registrant shall have  been  given  the  opportunity  to  be  heard, upon written notice to the  registrant, before an officer or employee of the  department  designated  for  such  purpose  by  the  commissioner. However, the commissioner may  temporarily suspend  a  registration,  demonstrator  numbers  or  number  plates  and/or  the authority to issue temporary registrations pending a  hearing.    Upon the denial of an application for a certificate  of  registration,  the applicant shall, upon written request made within ten days after the  applicant is notified of such denial, be entitled to a hearing before an  officer or employee of the department designated for such purpose by the  commissioner.    5.

Change   of  ownership.  Whenever  an  ATV  is  transferred,  the  certificate of registration shall be properly signed and executed by the  owner showing that the ownership of the ATV  has  been  transferred  and  such  certificate  shall  be  given  to  the  new  owner.

The old certificate  of registration, properly signed by the previous owner or other  indicia  as  prescribed  by  regulation  of  the commissioner, shall constitute a  temporary registration for such new owner for a period determined by the  commissioner from the date such ATV was transferred to the new owner. In  the event that such ATV was purchased  from  a  registered  dealer,  the  application  must  be accompanied by the old certificate of registration  transferred to the dealer, the required fee, and by any other  forms  or  documents completed and submitted as prescribed by the commissioner.    5.

VAT2407,"Vehicle and Traffic      2407. Liability  insurance.  1. An ATV which is operated anywhere in  this state other than on lands of the owner of the ATV shall be  covered  by  a  policy  of  insurance,  in  such  language  and  form as shall be  determined and established by the superintendent of financial  services,  issued  by an insurance carrier authorized to do business in this state.  Such policy shall provide for coverages required of an  ""owner's  policy  of  liability  insurance""  as  set forth in paragraph (a) of subdivision  four of section three hundred eleven of this chapter. In  lieu  of  such  insurance  coverage  as  hereinabove  provided, the commissioner, in his  discretion  and  upon  application  of  a  governmental  agency   having  registered  in  its  name one or more ATVs, may waive the requirement of  insurance by a private insurance carrier  and  issue  a  certificate  of  self-insurance,  when  he  is satisfied that such governmental agency is  possessed of financial ability to respond to judgments obtained  against  it,  arising  out  of  the ownership, use or operation of such ATVs. The  commissioner may also waive the requirement of insurance  by  a  private  insurance  carrier  and  issue  a  certificate  of  self-insurance  upon  application of any person or any other corporation, having registered in  its name, one or more ATVs and furnishing of proof that a certificate of  self-insurance has  been  issued  and  is  in  effect  pursuant  to  the  provisions of section three hundred sixteen of this chapter.    2.  Proof  of  insurance as required by this section shall be produced  and displayed by the owner or operator of such ATV upon the  request  of  any  magistrate or any person having authority to enforce the provisions  of this chapter. The failure to produce such proof upon the  request  of  any  such  person  shall  not  be  an  offense  but shall be presumptive  evidence that the ATV is being operated without having such insurance in  force and effect.    3. Proof of insurance as required by this section  shall  be  produced  and displayed by the owner or operator of such ATV to any person who has  suffered  or  claims to have suffered either personal injury or property  damage as a result of  the  operation  of  such  ATV  by  the  owner  or  operator,   if   such   insurance   coverage   was  required  under  the  circumstances of such operation. It shall be an affirmative  defense  to  any  prosecution for a violation of this subdivision that such proof was  so produced or displayed within twenty-four hours of receiving notice of  such injury or damage, or the claim of such injury or damage.    4. No owner of an ATV shall operate or permit the same to be  operated  anywhere  in  this  state  other  than  on lands of the owner of the ATV  without having in full force and effect the liability insurance coverage  required by this section, and no person shall operate an ATV anywhere in  this state other than on  lands  of  the  owner  of  the  ATV  with  the  knowledge that such insurance is not in full force and effect."
VAT2408,"Vehicle and Traffic      2408. Special  events. 1. The commissioner shall adopt and may, from  time to time, amend rules and regulations determining the special events  which shall be subject to  permit  and  designating  the  equipment  and  facilities  necessary  for  safe operation of ATVs and for the safety of  operators, participants, and observers in such special events. Copies of  such regulations shall be furnished by the commissioner  to  any  person  making an application therefor.    2.  Whenever  a  special  event  is proposed to be held, the person in  charge thereof shall, at  least  thirty  days  prior  thereto,  file  an  application  with  appropriate governmental agencies having jurisdiction  over the site of such event to hold such special event. The  application  shall  set forth the date and location of the proposed special event and  such other information as the governmental  agencies  may  require,  and  such  event  shall  not  be conducted without written authorization from  such governmental agencies. Governmental agencies shall either grant  or  deny  authorization  to  hold  a  special event within thirty days after  receipt of an application for authorization. The commissioner  shall  be  furnished  with  a  copy  of  all  such applications. No permit shall be  required for a closed-circuit special event  held  entirely  on  private  property,  but  appropriate  governmental  agencies shall be notified of  such event at least thirty days prior thereto.    3. ATVs  operated  at  special  events  shall  be  exempted  from  the  provisions  of this article concerning mufflers, lights and tires during  the time of such event, including all pre-race practice at the  location  of said event."
VAT2409,"Vehicle and Traffic      2409. ATV  safety course and safety certificate. 1. Safety course or  courses.

The  commissioner  may  permit  any  such safety training course to be given by any private  person,  club,  association  or  municipality  which   meets   standards  established  by  the  commissioner.  The  commissioner  may  establish a  reasonable fee which any such person  or  entity  may  charge  for  such  course or courses.    2.  Safety  certificate. Upon successful completion of a safety course  given in conformity with subdivision one of this section by a person ten  years of age or over, the person or entity which gave the  course  shall  notify the commissioner of such completion in a manner prescribed by the  commissioner,  The commissioner shall, upon receipt of such information,  issue an ATV safety certificate  to  the  person  who  has  successfully  completed  the  course.  Such  certificate may be limited to the type of  vehicle for which the course was given."

""Leased lands"" as  herein  used  shall  not  include  lands  leased  by  an  organization  of  which  said  operator or his parent or  guardian is a member.    2. A person ten years of age but less than sixteen years  of  age  who  has  received  safety training as prescribed by the commissioner and has  received  the  appropriate  ATV  safety  certificate   issued   by   the  commissioner  may  operate  an ATV in the same manner as a person who is  sixteen years of age or older.    3. The failure of a person to exhibit an ATV safety  certificate  upon  demand  to  any  magistrate  or  any  other  officer having authority to  enforce the provisions of this article shall  not  be  an  offense,  but  shall be presumptive evidence that such person is not the holder of such  certificate.    4. No parent or guardian shall authorize or knowingly permit his child  or  ward,  if under sixteen years of age, to operate an ATV in violation  of any provision of this article, any rules or  regulations  promulgated  thereunder, or the provisions of any local law or ordinance.    5.  No  owner or other person in possession of any ATV shall authorize  or knowingly permit any person under sixteen years  of  age  to  operate  such  an ATV in violation of any provision of this article, any rules or  regulations promulgated thereunder, or the provisions of any  local  law  or ordinance."

The operator of any ATV involved in any  accident  resulting  in  injuries  to or death of any person or in which  property damage in the estimated amount of six hundred dollars  or  more  is  sustained,  shall  immediately  notify  the  nearest law enforcement  agency and shall within ten days after such accident report  the  matter  in  writing  to  the  department,  with a copy thereof to the sheriff or  police commissioner of the county in which said  accident  occurred.  If  such operator is physically incapable of making such report and there is  another   participant   in   the  accident  not  so  incapacitated  such  participant shall make the report within the allotted  time  after  such  accident.  In  the  event  that  there  is  no other participant and the  operator is other than the  owner,  then  the  owner  shall  within  the  prescribed period of time, after learning of the facts of such accident,  report  the  matter to the department, together with such information as  may have come to his knowledge relating to  such  accident.  Every  such  operator  of  an ATV, or participant of any such accident, or the owner,  of the ATV involved in any such accident,  shall  make  such  other  and  additional reports as the commissioner shall require.    2.

In the event the person  sustaining the damage is not present  at  the  place  where  the  damage  occurred,  the  operator  shall,  as soon as physically able, report the  same to the nearest law enforcement agency.    3. A peace, police, or judicial officer who investigates  or  receives  information  of an accident involving an ATV shall make a written report  of the investigation or information received, and such additional  facts  relating  to the accident as may come to his knowledge and mail the same  within forty-eight hours to the department and keep a record thereof  in  his office.    4.  Failure  of any person to report an accident as herein provided or  failure to give  correctly  the  information  required  of  him  by  the  commissioner  in  connection with such report shall be a misdemeanor and  shall constitute a ground for suspension or revocation of the ATV safety  certificate of any person or the certificate of registration of any  ATV  involved  in  the accident. The commissioner may temporarily suspend the  ATV safety certificate of the person failing to make such report or  the  certificate  of  registration  of the ATV involved in the accident until  such report has been filed."

Section  1.  The  state  of  New  Jersey  by  appropriate  legislation  concurring herein, the states of New York and New Jersey hereby  declare  and agree that the vehicular traffic moving across the interstate waters  within  the  port  of New York district, created by the compact of April  thirty, nineteen hundred twenty-one, between the said states, which said  phrase ""interstate waters"" as used in this act shall include the portion  of the Hudson river within the said port of New York district  north  of  the  New  Jersey  state  line, constitutes a general movement of traffic  which follows the most accessible and practicable routes, and  that  the  users  of each bridge or tunnel over or under the said waters benefit by  the existence of every other bridge or tunnel since all such bridges and  tunnels as a group facilitate the movement of such traffic  and  relieve  congestion  at each of the several bridges and tunnels.  Accordingly the  two said states, in the interest  of  the  users  of  such  bridges  and  tunnels  and  the  general  public,  hereby agree that the construction,  maintenance, operation and control of  all  such  bridges  and  tunnels,  heretofore  or  hereafter  authorized  by  the two said states, shall be  unified under the port of New York  authority  (hereinafter  called  the  port  authority), to the end that the tolls and other revenues therefrom  shall be applied so far as practicable to the costs of the construction,  maintenance and operation of said bridges and tunnels  as  a  group  and  economies  in  operation  effected,  it being the policy of the two said  states that such bridges and tunnels shall as a group be in all respects  self-sustaining.      2.  In  furtherance  of  the  aforesaid  policy,  and  in   partial  effectuation  of  the  comprehensive  plan heretofore adopted by the two  said states for the development of the said port of New  York  district,  the  control,  operation,  tolls  and  other  revenues  of the vehicular  tunnel, known as the Holland tunnel, under the Hudson river between  the  city  of  Jersey  City  and the city of New York, shall be vested in the  port authority as hereinafter provided; and the port authority is hereby  authorized and empowered to construct,  own,  maintain  and  operate  an  interstate vehicular crossing under the Hudson river to consist of three  tubes (hereinafter called the Midtown Hudson tunnel), together with such  approaches  thereto  and connections with highways as the port authority  may deem necessary or desirable.    The port authority shall from time to time make studies,  surveys  and  investigations   to   determine  the  necessity  and  practicability  of  vehicular bridges and tunnels over or under interstate waters within the  said port of New York district, in addition to the said  Midtown  Hudson  tunnel  and Holland tunnel and to the George Washington bridge, Goethals  bridge, Outerbridge Crossing and  Bayonne  bridge,  and  report  to  the  governors and legislatures of the two states thereon. The port authority  shall not proceed with the construction of any such additional vehicular  bridges and tunnels over or under said interstate waters until hereafter  expressly  authorized by the two said states, but the second deck of the  George Washington bridge shall be considered an addition and improvement  to the said bridge and not such an additional vehicular bridge, and  the  port authority's power and authorization to construct, own, maintain and  operate  said  second  deck  for highway vehicular or rail rapid transit  traffic or both is hereby acknowledged and confirmed.    Except as may be agreed  upon  between  the  port  authority  and  the  municipality  in  which  they  shall  be  located, the approaches to the  George Washington bridge hereafter constructed  on  the  New  York  side  shall  be  located  as  follows:  between Amsterdam avenue and Pinehurst  avenue, the  approaches  shall  be  located  between  west  One  hundred  seventy-eighth street and west One hundred seventy-ninth street; between  Pinehurst  avenue and Cabrini boulevard, the approaches shall be between  west  One  hundred  seventy-eighth street and west One hundred eightieth  street; between Cabrini boulevard and Haven avenue, the approaches shall  be between west One hundred seventy-seventh street and the line parallel  to the northerly side of west  One  hundred  eightieth  street  and  one  hundred  twenty-five  feet  north of the building line on the north side  thereof; between Haven avenue and Service street  north  of  the  George  Washington  bridge,  the  approaches  shall be between the bridge and an  extension of the building line on the northerly side of west One hundred  eightieth  street.  Except  as  so  limited,  the  port  authority   may  effectuate  such  approaches, connections, highway extensions or highway  improvements as it shall deem necessary or desirable in relation to  the  George Washington bridge, located in or extending across the counties in  which  such  bridge  is  located,  and,  in its discretion, may do so by  agreement with any other public agency; such agreement may  provide  for  the   construction,   ownership,   maintenance   or  operation  of  such  approaches, connections or highway extensions or highway improvements by  such other public agency.    *  2-a. The port authority shall inspect bridges located  within  the  state  of  New York and under the authority's jurisdiction in accordance  with criteria established for other publicly-owned  bridges  within  the  state.    * NB Effective upon passage by the state of New Jersey.      3.  The  entrances, exits and approaches to the said Midtown Hudson  tunnel, on the New York side, shall be between West Thirty-fifth  street  and  West  Forty-first street and in the vicinity of Ninth avenue and to  the west thereof, in the borough of Manhattan, city  of  New  York.  The  approaches  to  the  said  Midtown  Hudson tunnel on the New Jersey side  shall be so located and constructed as to permit tunnel traffic to  pass  over  or  under  the  tracks  of  the  New York, Susquehanna and Western  Railroad Company and  the  Northern  Railroad  Company  of  New  Jersey,  immediately  west  of the Palisades, without crossing the said tracks at  grade, and as to permit connections with New Jersey state highway routes  in the vicinity of the said tracks. The said Midtown Hudson tunnel shall  have an appropriate entrance and exit  in  the  township  of  Weehawken,  county of Hudson, state of New Jersey.      4.  The  port  authority  shall, so far as it deems it practicable,  treat as a single unified operation the  construction,  maintenance  and  operation  of  the  said Midtown Hudson tunnel, the said Holland tunnel,  the two vehicular bridges over the Arthur  Kill,  the  vehicular  bridge  over  the  Kill  van Kull, the vehicular bridge over the Hudson river at  Fort Lee, and any other  vehicular  bridges  or  tunnels  which  it  may  construct  or  operate,  raising moneys for the construction thereof and  for the making of additions and improvements thereto in whole or in part  upon its own obligations, and establishing and levying  such  tolls  and  other  charges  as  it  may  deem  necessary  to secure from all of such  bridges and tunnels as a group, at least sufficient revenue to meet  the  expenses  of the construction, maintenance and operation of such bridges  and tunnels as a group, and to provide for the payment of  the  interest  upon and amortization and retirement of and the fulfillment of the terms  of  all  bonds  and  other  securities and obligations which it may have  issued or incurred in connection therewith.    The additions and improvements to bridges and tunnels  constructed  or  operated  by  it  which  the  port  authority  is  hereby  authorized to  effectuate shall include but not be limited to  parking  facilities,  by  which  is  meant  transportation  facilities  consisting  of one or more  areas, buildings, structures, improvements, or other  accommodations  or  appurtenances  necessary,  convenient or desirable in the opinion of the  port authority for the parking or storage of motor vehicles of users  of  such bridges and tunnels and other members of the general public and for  the  transfer  of the operators and passengers of such motor vehicles to  and from omnibuses and other motor vehicles operated by carriers over or  through such bridges or tunnels, and for purposes incidental thereto.    Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prevent the port authority  from establishing, levying and collecting tolls  and  other  charges  in  connection  with  any parking facility in addition to and other than the  tolls or charges established, levied and collected  in  connection  with  the  bridge  or tunnel to which such parking facility is an addition and  improvement or any other bridge or tunnel.    The port authority shall not proceed  with  the  construction  of  any  parking  facility as an addition and improvement to any bridge or tunnel  other than a parking facility in the township of  North  Bergen  in  the  state  of  New Jersey at or in the vicinity of the Midtown Hudson tunnel  and its approaches and connections, except as  heretofore  or  hereafter  expressly authorized.      4A.  The  port authority is hereby authorized and empowered, in its  discretion, to  construct,  own,  maintain  and  operate  in  Washington  Heights  in  the borough of Manhattan, New York city, as an addition and  improvement to the vehicular bridge over the Hudson river at  Fort  Lee,  known  as  and  hereinafter  in  this  section referred to as the George  Washington bridge, a  bus  passenger  facility,  by  which  is  meant  a  facility  consisting of one or more buildings, structures, improvements,  loading or unloading areas, parking areas or other facilities necessary,  convenient or desirable in the opinion of the  port  authority  for  the  accommodation of omnibuses and other motor vehicles operated by carriers  engaged  in  the  transportation  of  passengers,  or  for  the loading,  unloading, interchange or transfer of such passengers or their  baggage,  or   otherwise  for  the  accommodation,  use  or  convenience  of  such  passengers  or  such  carriers  or  their  employees  and  for  purposes  incidental thereto.    Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prevent the port authority  from  establishing,  levying  and  collecting tolls and other charges in  connection with such bus passenger facility in  addition  to  and  other  than   the  tolls  or  charges  established,  levied  and  collected  in  connection with the George Washington bridge  or  any  other  bridge  or  tunnel.      5.  The  control,  operation,  tolls and other revenues of the said  Holland tunnel and its entrance and exit plazas  and  of  all  real  and  personal  property  appurtenant thereto or used in connection therewith,  shall vest in the port  authority  upon  the  making  of  the  following  payments by the port authority to each of the said two states:    (a) An amount equal to the moneys contributed by such state toward the  cost  of  construction of the said Holland tunnel, with interest thereon  at the rate of four and one-quarter percentum per annum from the date or  dates on which such moneys were contributed by such state to the date of  the payment to such state;    (b) Less, however, the share of such state in the net revenues of  the  said  tunnel  to the date of the said payment, and less interest on such  net revenues at the rate of four and  one-quarter  percentum  per  annum  from  the  dates  on  which  the said net revenues were received by such  state to the date of the said payment;    (c) And in the case of the payment to the state of New York,  less  an  amount equal to the moneys which the said state has agreed to advance to  the  port authority (but which have not as yet been advanced to the port  authority) in aid  of  bridge  construction,  during  the  fiscal  years  commencing   in   nineteen   hundred  thirty-one  and  nineteen  hundred  thirty-two, pursuant to chapter seven hundred and sixty-one of the  laws  of  New York of nineteen hundred twenty-six and chapter three hundred of  the  laws  of  New  York  of  nineteen  hundred  twenty-seven  and  acts  amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, discounted, however, in the  case  of each advance at the rate of four and one-quarter per centum per  annum, from the date of the said payment to the state of New York to the  date upon which  such  advance  is  to  be  available  pursuant  to  the  aforesaid statutes.    In computing interest as aforesaid upon the moneys contributed by each  of  the  said  two  states  toward  the cost of construction of the said  Holland tunnel, such moneys shall be deemed to have been contributed  by  such  state  upon  the first day of the month following the month during  which there were presented to the comptroller of such  state  for  audit  and  payment,  the  schedules and vouchers pursuant to which such moneys  were paid. In computing interest as  aforesaid  upon  the  net  revenues  received  by  each  of  the  said two states, such net revenues shall be  deemed to have been received by such  state  upon  the  date  when  such  revenues  were credited to such state or to the commission of such state  pursuant to paragraph eleven of  article  fourteen  of  the  compact  of  December thirty, nineteen hundred nineteen, between the two said states.      6.  If  the  amount  paid by the port authority to the state of New  Jersey pursuant to the preceding section of this act shall be less  than  an  amount  which,  together  with  the  moneys then in the sinking fund  established by chapter three hundred and fifty-two of the  laws  of  New  Jersey  of nineteen hundred twenty and chapter two hundred and sixty-two  of the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred  twenty-four,  hereinafter  called  the  New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel sinking fund (other  than moneys set apart to pay interest for the then current year upon the  bonds of the state of New Jersey authorized by the aforesaid acts of the  state of New Jersey, hereinafter called New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland  tunnel bonds), will be  equal  to  the  principal  amount  of  the  then  outstanding  New  Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel bonds, then and in  such event, the port authority shall in addition pay to the state of New  Jersey an amount which, together with the amount paid under and pursuant  to the preceding section hereof and the moneys then in said  New  Jersey  Camden  bridge-Holland  tunnel  sinking  fund,  will  be  equal  to  the  principal  amount  of   the   then   outstanding   New   Jersey   Camden  bridge-Holland  tunnel  bonds;  and shall, moreover, pay to the state of  New York a like amount.     7. The amount payable by the port authority to the state of New York  pursuant to sections five and six of this act shall be paid by the  port  authority  into the treasury of the state of New York upon the thirtieth  day of June, nineteen hundred thirty-one, or at an earlier date  at  the  option  of the port authority on five days' notice to the comptroller of  the state of New York, upon a voucher signed and  audited  by  the  said  comptroller,   who   is   hereby   authorized  to  consummate  the  said  transaction.     8. The amount payable by the port authority  to  the  state  of  New  Jersey  pursuant  to  sections five and six of this act shall be paid by  the port authority to  the  sinking  fund  commission  created  by  said  chapter  three  hundred  and  fifty-two  of  the  laws  of New Jersey of  nineteen hundred twenty and said chapter two hundred  and  sixty-two  of  the  laws  of  New  Jersey  of nineteen hundred twenty-four, hereinafter  called  the  New  Jersey  Camden  bridge-Holland  tunnel  sinking   fund  commission  upon the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred thirty-one,  or such other date as may be  agreed  upon  by  the  said  sinking  fund  commission  and the port authority, upon a voucher signed and audited by  the said sinking  fund  commission,  which  said  commission  is  hereby  authorized  to consummate said transaction; and the said moneys shall be  deposited  in  the  said New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel sinking  fund, and shall for all purposes be deemed to  be  a  part  thereof  and  subject  to  the  appropriation  of the moneys in the said sinking fund,  made by the aforesaid statutes of the state of New Jersey.    The income and interest received from or accruing upon the  moneys  in  the  aforesaid New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel sinking fund, and  from the investment thereof, shall be set apart and held by the said New  Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel  sinking  fund  commission  for  the  payment  of  interest  on New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel bonds,  and shall be subject to the appropriation made of moneys  so  set  apart  and  held,  by  the  aforesaid  statutes of the state of New Jersey, and  shall be applied to the payment of such interest.     9. Upon the making of the foregoing payments by the  port  authority  to  the  two  said  states,  the  provisions  of the compact of December  thirty, nineteen hundred nineteen, between the said two states, relating  to the construction  and  operation  of  the  said  Holland  tunnel,  as  amended, so far as inconsistent herewith or with the rules, practice and  procedure or general authority of the port authority, shall be and shall  be  deemed  to  be abrogated; and chapter four hundred and twenty-one of  the laws of New York of nineteen hundred thirty, and chapter two hundred  and forty-seven of the laws of New Jersey of  nineteen  hundred  thirty,  making the port authority the agent of the two states in connection with  the operation of the said Holland tunnel shall cease to be effective.     10. The plans of the connections with state or municipal highways of  any  vehicular  bridge  or tunnel which the port authority may hereafter  construct (including the plans of any additional connections of existing  bridges or tunnels with state or municipal highways), shall  be  subject  to  the  approval of the governor of the state in which such connections  shall be located. Either state may require  by  appropriate  legislation  that   such  connections  shall  be  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  municipality of that state in which they shall be located; and  in  such  event,  the  approval of such municipality shall be given as provided in  article twelve of the said compact of  April  thirty,  nineteen  hundred  twenty-one. Except as limited herein, the port authority shall determine  all matters pertaining to such bridges and tunnels.     11. The port authority is hereby authorized to make and enforce such  rules  and regulations and to establish, levy and collect such tolls and  other charges in connection with any vehicular bridges and tunnels which  it may now or hereafter be authorized  to  own,  construct,  operate  or  control  (including  the said Holland tunnel and the said Midtown Hudson  tunnel), as it may deem necessary, proper or desirable, which said tolls  and charges shall be at least sufficient to meet  the  expenses  of  the  construction,  operation and maintenance thereof, and to provide for the  payment of, with interest upon, and the amortization and  retirement  of  bonds  or  other securities or obligations issued or incurred for bridge  or tunnel purposes.  There  shall  be  allocated  to  the  cost  of  the  construction,  operation  and  maintenance  of such bridges and tunnels,  such proportion of the general expenses of  the  port  authority  as  it  shall deem properly chargeable thereto.    The  moneys  in  the  general  reserve  fund  of  the  port  authority  (authorized by chapter five of  the  laws  of  New  Jersey  of  nineteen  hundred  thirty-one,  as amended, and chapter forty-eight of the laws of  New York of nineteen hundred thirty-one, as amended) may be  pledged  in  whole  or in part by the port authority as security for or applied by it  to the repayment with interest of any moneys which  it  may  raise  upon  bonds or other securities or obligations issued or incurred from time to  time  for any of the purposes of this act or secured in whole or in part  by the pledge of the revenues of the port authority from any  bridge  or  tunnel  or  both so issued or incurred and so secured; and the moneys in  said general reserve fund may be applied by the port  authority  to  the  fulfillment  of any other undertakings which it may assume to or for the  benefit  of  the  holders  of  any  such  bonds,  securities  or   other  obligations.    Subject  to prior liens and pledges (and to the obligation of the port  authority to apply revenues to the maintenance of  its  general  reserve  fund  in  the  amount  prescribed  by the said statutes authorizing said  fund), the revenues of the port authority from  facilities  established,  constructed,  acquired  or  effectuated  through the issuance or sale of  bonds of the port authority secured by a pledge of its  general  reserve  fund may be pledged in whole or in part as security for or applied by it  to  the  repayment  with  interest of any moneys which it may raise upon  bonds or other securities or obligations issued or incurred from time to  time for any of the purposes of this act or secured in whole or in  part  by  the  pledge of the revenues of the port authority from any bridge or  tunnel or both so issued or incurred and so secured, and  said  revenues  may  be  applied  by  the port authority to the fulfillment of any other  undertakings which it may assume to or for the benefit of the holders of  such bonds, securities or other obligations.    In the event that at any time the balance of moneys  theretofore  paid  into  the general reserve fund and not applied therefrom shall exceed an  amount equal to one-tenth of the  par  value  of  all  bonds  legal  for  investment, as defined and limited in the said statutes authorizing said  fund,  issued  by  the  port authority and currently outstanding at such  time, by reason of the  retirement  of  bonds  or  other  securities  or  obligations issued or incurred from time to time for any of the purposes  of this act or secured in whole or in part by the pledge of the revenues  of  the  port  authority  from any bridge or tunnel or both so issued or  incurred and so secured, the par value of  which  had  theretofore  been  included  in  the computation of said one-tenth, then the port authority  may pledge or apply such excess for and only for the purposes for  which  it  is  authorized  by the said statutes authorizing said fund to pledge  the moneys in the general reserve fund and such pledge may  be  made  in  advance of the time when such excess may occur.      12. The two said states covenant and agree with each other and with  the holders of any bonds or other securities or obligations of the  port  authority,  issued  or  incurred  for  bridge  or tunnel purposes and as  security for which there may or shall be pledged the tolls and  revenues  or  any  part  thereof  of any vehicular bridge or tunnel (including the  said Holland tunnel and the said Midtown Hudson tunnel),  that  the  two  said  states will not, so long as any of such bonds or other obligations  remain outstanding and unpaid, diminish or impair the power of the  port  authority  to  establish,  levy  and  collect tolls and other charges in  connection therewith; and that the two said states will not, so long  as  any  of  such  bonds or other obligations remain outstanding and unpaid,  authorize the construction of any vehicular bridges or tunnels  over  or  under  interstate  waters  as herein defined within the said port of New  York district, by any person or body other than the port  authority,  in  competition  with  those  whose  tolls  or other revenues are pledged as  aforesaid; provided that nothing herein contained  shall  be  deemed  to  refer  to  the  bridge authorized by the act of congress of July eleven,  eighteen hundred ninety, chapter six hundred and  sixty-nine,  and  acts  amendatory  thereof  and supplemental thereto; and provided further that  nothing  herein  contained  shall  preclude  the  authorization  of  the  construction  of such competitive tunnels or bridges by other persons or  bodies if and when adequate provision shall  be  made  by  law  for  the  protection of those advancing money upon such obligations.     13. The bonds or other securities or obligations which may be issued  or  incurred  by the port authority pursuant to this act, or as security  for which there may be pledged the tolls and other revenues or any  part  thereof  of  any  vehicular bridge or tunnel (including the said Holland  tunnel and the said Midtown Hudson tunnel) now or  hereafter  authorized  by the two said states or both so issued or incurred and so secured, are  hereby  made  securities  in  which all state and municipal officers and  bodies, all banks, bankers, trust companies, savings banks, savings  and  loan  associations, investment companies and other persons carrying on a  banking business, all insurance companies,  insurance  associations  and  other persons carrying on an insurance business, and all administrators,  executors,  guardians,  trustees  and  other  fiduciaries  and all other  persons whatsoever who are now or may hereafter be authorized to  invest  in  bonds  or  other  obligations of the state, may properly and legally  invest any funds, including capital, belonging to them or  within  their  control;  and  said  bonds or other securities or obligations are hereby  made securities which may properly and legally  be  deposited  with  and  shall  be  received  by any state or municipal officer or agency for any  purpose for which the deposit of bonds  or  other  obligations  of  this  state is now or may hereafter be authorized.     14. The construction, maintenance and operation of vehicular bridges  and  tunnels  within  the  said port of New York district (including the  said Holland tunnel and the said Midtown Hudson tunnel), are and will be  in all respects for the benefit of the people of the states of New  York  and  New  Jersey,  for the increase of their commerce and prosperity and  for the improvement of their health and living conditions; and the  port  authority  shall  be  regarded  as  performing an essential governmental  function in undertaking  the  construction,  maintenance  and  operation  thereof  and in carrying out the provisions of law relating thereto, and  shall be required to pay  no  taxes  or  assessments  upon  any  of  the  property acquired or used by it for such purposes.      15.  If  for  any  of the purposes of this act (including temporary  construction purposes, and the making of additions  or  improvements  to  bridges  or  tunnels already constructed), the port authority shall find  it necessary or convenient  to  acquire  any  real  property  as  herein  defined,  whether  for  immediate  or future use, the port authority may  find and determine that such property, whether a fee simple absolute  or  a  lesser  interest,  is  required  for  a  public  use,  and  upon such  determination, the said property shall be and  shall  be  deemed  to  be  required  for  such  public  use  until otherwise determined by the port  authority; and with the exceptions hereinafter specifically  noted,  the  said  determination shall not be affected by the fact that such property  has theretofore been taken for, or is then devoted to, a public use; but  the public use in the hands or under the control of the  port  authority  shall  be  deemed  superior  to the public use in the hands of any other  person, association or corporation.    The port authority may acquire and is  hereby  authorized  to  acquire  such  property,  whether  a fee simple absolute or a lesser interest, by  the exercise of the right of eminent domain under and  pursuant  to  the  provisions of the eminent domain procedure law of the state of New York,  in  the  case of property located in such state, and revised statutes of  New Jersey, Title 20:1-1 et seq., in the case  of  property  located  in  such  state,  or  at  the  option  of  the port authority as provided in  section fifteen of chapter forty-three of the  laws  of  New  Jersey  of  nineteen  hundred  forty-seven, as amended, for the condemnation of real  property for air terminal purposes, in the case of property  located  in  such  state, or pursuant to such other and alternate procedure as may be  provided by law.    Where  a person entitled to an award in the proceedings to acquire any  real property for any of the purposes of this act, remains in possession  of such property after the time of the vesting  of  title  in  the  port  authority,  the  reasonable  value  of  his  use  and  occupancy of such  property subsequent to such time, as fixed by agreement or by the  court  in  such proceedings or by any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be  a lien against such award, subject only to liens of record at  the  time  of the vesting of title in the port authority.    Nothing  herein  contained  shall  be  construed  to prohibit the port  authority from bringing any proceedings to remove a cloud  on  title  or  such  other  proceedings  as  it may, in its discretion, deem proper and  necessary, or  from  acquiring  any  such  property  by  negotiation  or  purchase.      16.  Anything  in  this  act  to  the  contrary notwithstanding, no  property now or hereafter  vested  in  or  held  by  any  county,  city,  borough,  village,  township or other municipality shall be taken by the  port authority, without the authority or consent of such  county,  city,  borough,  village,  township  or  other municipality as provided in said  compact of April thirty, nineteen hundred twenty-one, provided that  the  state  in  which  such county, city, borough, village, township or other  municipality is located may authorize such property to be taken  by  the  port  authority  by condemnation or the exercise of the right of eminent  domain without such authority or  consent;  nor  shall  anything  herein  impair or invalidate in any way any bonded indebtedness of the state, or  such county, city, borough, village, township or other municipality, nor  impair  the  provisions of law regulating the payment into sinking funds  of revenue derived from municipal property, or dedicating  the  revenues  derived  from  municipal  property,  to  a  specific  purpose.  The port  authority is hereby authorized and empowered to acquire  from  any  such  county,  city, borough, village, township or other municipality, or from  any other  public  agency  or  commission  having  jurisdiction  in  the  premises,  by  agreement  therewith,  and  such  county,  city, borough,  village,  township,   municipality,   public   agency   or   commission,  notwithstanding  any contrary provision of law, is hereby authorized and  empowered to grant and convey upon reasonable terms and conditions,  any  real  property,  which  may be necessary for the construction, operation  and maintenance  of  such  bridges  and  tunnels,  including  such  real  property  as  has  already been devoted to a public use. Each of the two  said states hereby consent  to  the  use  and  occupation  of  the  real  property  of  such  state  necessary for the construction, operation and  maintenance of bridges and tunnels constructed or operated  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  act, including lands of the state lying under  water.     17. The port authority and its duly authorized agents and  employees  may  enter  upon  any  land in this state for the purpose of making such  surveys, maps, or other examinations thereof as it may deem necessary or  convenient for the purposes of this act.     19. The term ""real property"" as used  in  this  act  is  defined  to  include  lands, structures, franchises, and interests in land, including  lands under water and riparian rights, and any and all things and rights  usually included within the said term, and includes not only fees simple  absolute but also any and  all  lesser  interests,  such  as  easements,  rights  of  way,  uses,  leases,  licenses  and  all  other  incorporeal  hereditaments and every estate, interest or right, legal  or  equitable,  including  terms  of  years,  and  liens  thereon  by  way of judgments,  mortgages or otherwise, and also claims for damage to real estate.      20.  Nothing  herein  contained  shall be construed to authorize or  permit the port authority to undertake the construction of any vehicular  bridge or tunnel over or under the Arthur Kill, unless or until adequate  provision has been made by law for the  protection  of  those  advancing  money upon the obligations of the port authority for the construction of  the  bridges  mentioned  in  chapter  two hundred and ten of the laws of  nineteen hundred twenty-five,  or  the  construction  of  any  vehicular  bridge or tunnel over or under the Hudson river, at or north of Sixtieth  street  in  the  borough of Manhattan, city of New York, unless or until  adequate provision has been made by law  for  the  protection  of  those  advancing  money  upon  the  obligations  of  the port authority for the  construction of the  bridge  mentioned  in  chapter  seven  hundred  and  sixty-one   of   the   laws  of  nineteen  hundred  twenty-six,  or  the  construction of any vehicular bridge or tunnel over or  under  the  Kill  van Kull unless or until adequate provision has been made by law for the  protection  of  those  advancing  money upon the obligations of the port  authority for the construction of the bridge mentioned in chapter  three  hundred of the laws of nineteen hundred twenty-seven.      21.  This section and the preceding sections hereof, except section  eighteen, constitute an agreement between the states of New York and New  Jersey supplementary to the compact between the two states  dated  April  thirty,  nineteen  hundred twenty-one, and amendatory thereof, and shall  be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes of said compact and of  the comprehensive plan heretofore adopted by the  two  states,  and  any  powers  granted  to the port authority by this act shall be deemed to be  in aid of and supplementary to and in no  case  a  limitation  upon  the  powers  heretofore  vested  in the port authority by the two said states  and/or by congress, except as herein otherwise provided.    Any  declarations  contained  in  this  act  with   respect   to   the  governmental  nature  of  bridges  and  tunnels  and to the exemption of  bridge and tunnel property from taxation and to the  discretion  of  the  port authority with respect to bridge and tunnel operations shall not be  construed to imply that other port authority property and operations are  not  of  a governmental nature, or that they are subject to taxation, or  that the determinations of the port authority with respect  thereto  are  not conclusive.    The  powers  vested  in  the  port authority herein (including but not  limited to the powers to acquire real property by  condemnation  and  to  make  or effectuate additions, improvements, approaches and connections)  shall be continuing powers and no exercise thereof shall  be  deemed  to  exhaust them or any of them.      22. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect, diminish  or impair the rights and obligations created by, or to repeal any of the  provisions of chapter three hundred and fifty-two of  the  laws  of  New  Jersey  of nineteen hundred twenty and chapter two hundred and sixty-two  of the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty-four.    If, however, any loss shall be suffered  by  or  accrue  to  the  said  sinking  fund,  and  if,  after  the  making  of the payment by the port  authority to the state of  New  Jersey  as  hereinbefore  provided,  the  moneys in the said sinking fund shall at any time be or become less than  an   amount  equal  to  the  principal  amount  of  the  then  currently  outstanding New Jersey Camden bridge-Holland tunnel  bonds,  or  if  the  income  and  interest currently received from or currently accruing upon  the moneys in the said sinking fund shall be or become  insufficient  to  pay  the  interest  currently  accruing  upon  or  currently  payable in  connection with the aforesaid New Jersey  Camden  bridge-Holland  tunnel  bonds,  the  state of New Jersey represents and agrees that it will make  good such deficits out of sources other  than  revenues  from  the  said  Holland tunnel.    The  said  payment  by  the  port authority to the state of New Jersey  constitutes repayment for all  moneys  contributed  by  the  said  state  toward  the  cost  of construction of the said Holland tunnel, including  the moneys diverted  and  appropriated  by  chapter  three  hundred  and  nineteen  of  the  laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty-six and  chapter fifty-eight of the  laws  of  New  Jersey  of  nineteen  hundred  twenty-seven  from the road fund, created by chapter fifteen of the laws  of New Jersey of nineteen hundred seventeen. The requirement of  chapter  fifty-eight  of  the laws of New Jersey of nineteen hundred twenty-seven  that the said moneys diverted and appropriated by the said  statutes  of  the  state of New Jersey shall be returned and credited to the said road  fund, with interest, shall be and shall be deemed to  be  satisfied  and  discharged  so  far  as  it  relates  to  the  revenues arising from the  operation of the said Holland tunnel.    The provisions  of  this  section  shall  constitute  a  covenant  and  agreement  by  the  state  of New York with the state of New Jersey, the  port authority and the holders of any bonds or other obligations of  the  port  authority,  as  security  for which the tolls and revenues of said  Holland tunnel may be pledged.     23. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to impair in any way  the obligation of the port authority to repay to the two states  any  or  all  advances  made  by  them  to  the  port  authority in aid of bridge  construction.     24. This act shall take effect upon the enactment into  law  by  the  state  of New Jersey of legislation having an identical effect with this  act, but if the state of New Jersey  shall  have  already  enacted  such  legislation this act shall take effect immediately."

(1)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of law to the  contrary, any city of the state having a population of  one  million  or  more  inhabitants,  acting through its local legislative body, is hereby  authorized and empowered to adopt and amend local laws imposing  in  any  such  city  taxes  on  cigarettes, cigars or smoking tobacco such as the  legislature has or would have power and authority to impose. Such  taxes  may be collected and administered by the fiscal officers of such city by  such means and in such manner as may be provided by such local laws. The  taxes  may  be  imposed  on  the use, sale, exchange, transfer, storage,  withdrawal, possession or retention of  cigarettes,  cigars  or  smoking  tobacco, provided, however, that nothing in this act shall authorize the  imposition  of a tax on the use, possession or retention (otherwise than  for sale) of two hundred cigarettes or less, of fifty cigars or less  or  of two pounds of smoking tobacco or less brought into the city on, or in  possession of, any person.    * (a) The rate of such tax on cigarettes shall not exceed seventy-five  cents  for  each  ten cigarettes or fraction thereof, provided, however,  that if a package of cigarettes contains more  than  twenty  cigarettes,  the  rate  of  tax on the cigarettes in such package in excess of twenty  shall be  thirty-eight  cents  for  each  five  cigarettes  or  fraction  thereof.  Such  tax  is  intended  to  be  imposed only once on the same  package of cigarettes.    * NB Effective until December 31, 2017    * (a) The basic rate of such tax on cigarettes shall  not  exceed  two  cents  for each ten cigarettes or fraction thereof and is intended to be  imposed only once on the same package of cigarettes; in addition to such  tax there may be imposed an additional tax at the following rates    (1) One and one-half cents for each ten cigarettes where either  their  tar content exceeds seventeen milligrams per cigarette or their nicotine  content exceeds one and one-tenth milligrams per cigarette;    (2)  Two cents for each ten cigarettes where their tar content exceeds  seventeen milligrams per cigarette and their  nicotine  content  exceeds  one and one-tenth milligrams per cigarette.    * NB Effective December 31, 2017    (b)  The  rate of such tax on cigars shall not exceed one cent on each  cigar sold at a price of not less than seven cents  and  not  more  than  fifteen  cents; two cents on each cigar sold at a price of not less than  sixteen cents and not more than twenty-nine cents; and  three  cents  on  each  cigar sold at a price of thirty cents or more. Where more than one  cigar is sold, whether or not in a package, box or container,  such  tax  shall  be  applied to each cigar on the basis of the price applicable to  each cigar. The tax shall not be applicable to cigars sold  at  a  price  less than seven cents a cigar.    (c)  The rate of such tax on smoking tobacco shall not exceed one cent  for each twenty cents or fraction thereof of the  price  at  which  such  smoking tobacco is sold.    (2)  As  used  herein, the term ""cigarette"" shall mean and include (a)  any roll for smoking made wholly or in part of tobacco or of  any  other  substance  wrapped  in  paper  or  in any other substance not containing  tobacco, and (b) any roll for smoking made wholly or in part of  tobacco  wrapped  in  any  substance  containing  tobacco  that,  because  of its  appearance, the type of tobacco used in the filler, or its packaging and  labeling, is likely to be offered to, or purchased by,  consumers  as  a  cigarette  described  in  paragraph  (a) of this subdivision. However, a  roll will not be considered to be a cigarette for purposes of  paragraph  (b)  of this subdivision if it is not treated as a cigarette for federal  excise tax purposes under the applicable federal statute  in  effect  on  April  first,  two thousand eight. The term ""cigar"" does not include any  cigarette as defined in this subdivision.    (3) A tax imposed hereunder shall have  application  only  within  the  territorial  limits of any such city and shall be in addition to any and  all other taxes. The method of collecting  any  tax  imposed  hereunder,  either with or without adhesive or meter stamps, shall be subject to the  approval of the state tax commission.    (4)   Any  tax  imposed  hereunder  shall  be  refunded  whenever  any  cigarettes upon which the tax has been paid have been sold  and  shipped  into another state for sale or use there.    (5) No tax imposed pursuant to this section shall apply to the sale of  cigarettes  under such circumstances that this state is without power to  impose such tax or to  cigarettes  sold  to  the  United  States  or  to  cigarettes  sold to or by a voluntary unincorporated organization of the  armed forces of the United States operating a  place  for  the  sale  of  goods  pursuant  to regulations promulgated by the appropriate executive  agency of the United States.    (6) Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable hereunder  shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or  any  other  reason  whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of  the civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to  the  supreme  court within four months after the giving of the notice of such  final determination, provided, however, that any such  proceeding  under  article  seventy-eight  of the civil practice law and rules shall not be  instituted by a person liable for the tax unless the amount of  any  tax  sought  to  be reviewed, with such interest and penalties thereon as may  be provided for by local law or regulation, shall be first deposited and  an undertaking filed, in such amount and with such sureties as a justice  of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding  be dismissed or the tax confirmed such person will  pay  all  costs  and  charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.    (7)  Where  any  tax  imposed  hereunder  shall have been erroneously,  illegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund  thereof duly made to the proper fiscal officer  or  officers,  and  such  officer  or  officers  or,  in the case of a city of one million or more  which has established tax appeals tribunal, such tax  appeals  tribunal,  shall  have made a determination denying such refund, such determination  shall be reviewable by a proceeding under article seventy-eight  of  the  civil practice law and rules, provided, however, that such proceeding is  instituted  within  four  months  after the giving of the notice of such  denial, that a final determination of tax due was not  previously  made,  and  that  an  undertaking  is  filed  with the proper fiscal officer or  officers in such amount and with such  sureties  as  a  justice  of  the  supreme  court  shall  approve  to the effect that if such proceeding be  dismissed or the tax confirmed, the person liable for the tax  will  pay  all  costs  and  charges  which  may  accrue  in the prosecution of such  proceeding.

Principles to govern the development:    First.  That  terminal  operations within the port district, so far as  economically practicable, should be unified;    Second. That there should be  consolidation  of  shipments  at  proper  classification   points  so  as  to  eliminate  duplication  of  effort,  inefficient loading of equipment and realize reduction in expenses;    Third. That there should be the most direct routing of all commodities  so as to avoid centers of  congestion,  conflicting  currents  and  long  truck-hauls;    Fourth.  That  terminal  stations  established under the comprehensive  plan should be union stations, so far as practicable;    Fifth. That the process of coordinating facilities should  so  far  as  practicable  adapt  existing  facilities  as  integral  parts of the new  system,  so  as  to  avoid  needless  destruction  of  existing  capital  investment and reduce so far as may be possible the requirements for new  capital;  and  endeavor  should  be  made to obtain the consent of local  municipalities within the port district for the  coordination  of  their  present  and  contemplated  port  and terminal facilities with the whole  plan.    Sixth. That freight from all railroads must be brought to all parts of  the port wherever practicable  without  cars  breaking  bulk,  and  this  necessitates  tunnel  connection between New Jersey and Long Island, and  tunnel or bridge connections between other parts of the port;    Seventh. That there should  be  urged  upon  the  federal  authorities  improvement of channels so as to give access for that type of waterborne  commerce   adapted  to  the  various  forms  of  development  which  the  respective shorefronts and adjacent lands of the port  would  best  lend  themselves to;    Eighth. That highways for motor truck traffic should be laid out so as  to permit the most efficient inter-relation between terminals, piers and  industrial establishments not equipped with railroad sidings and for the  distribution of building materials and many other commodities which must  be  handled  by  trucks;  these  highways  to  connect  with existing or  projected bridges, tunnels and ferries.    Ninth. That definite methods for prompt relief should be devised which  can be applied for the better coordination  and  operation  of  existing  facilities   while  larger  and  more  comprehensive  plans  for  future  development are being carried out.      2.  The  bridges,  tunnels and belt lines forming the comprehensive  plan are generally and in outline indicated on maps filed by the port of  New York authority in the offices of the secretaries of  the  states  of  New York and New Jersey and are hereinafter described in outline.      3.  Tunnels  and  bridges to form part of the plan. (a) A tunnel or  tunnels connecting the New Jersey shore and the Brooklyn  shore  of  New  York  to  provide  through  line connection between the transcontinental  railroads now having their terminals in New Jersey with the Long  Island  railroad  and  the  New York connecting railroad on Long Island and with  the New York Central and Hudson River railroad and  the  New  York,  New  Haven  and  Hartford  railroad  in  the Bronx, and to provide continuous  transportation  of  freight  between  the  Queens,  Brooklyn  and  Bronx  sections  of  the  port to and from all parts of the westerly section of  the port, for all of the transcontinental railroads.    (b) A bridge and/or tunnel across or under the Arthur kill, and/or the  existing bridge enlarged, to provide direct freight carriage between New  Jersey and Staten Island.    (c) The location of all such tunnels or bridges to be at the shortest,  most accessible and most economical points practicable,  taking  account  of  existing  facilities  now  located  within  the  port  district  and  providing for and taking account of all  reasonably  foreseeable  future  growth in all parts of the district.      4.  Manhattan service. The island of Manhattan to be connected with  New Jersey by bridge or tunnel, or both, and  freight  destined  to  and  from Manhattan to be carried underground, so far as practicable, by such  system,  automatic  electric  as  hereinafter described or otherwise, as  will  furnish  the  most   expeditious,   economical   and   practicable  transportation  of  freight,  especially  meat,  produce, milk and other  commodities comprising the daily needs of the people. Suitable  markets,  union  inland  terminal stations and warehouses to be laid out at points  most convenient to the homes and industries upon the  island,  the  said  system   to  be  connected  with  all  the  trans-continental  railroads  terminating in New Jersey and by appropriate  connection  with  the  New  York  Central  and  Hudson  River  railroad, the New York, New Haven and  Hartford and the Long Island railroads.     5.

The determination of the exact location, system and character of  each  of  the   said   tunnels,   bridges,   belt   lines,   approaches,  classification  yards, warehouses, terminals or other improvements shall  be made by the port authority after public hearings and  further  study,  but in general the location thereof shall be as indicated upon said map,  and as herein described.      7.  The right to add to, modify or change any part of the foregoing  comprehensive plan is reserved by each state, with  the  concurrence  of  the other.      8. The port of New York authority is hereby authorized and directed  to proceed with the development of the port of New  York  in  accordance  with   said  comprehensive  plan  as  rapidly  as  may  be  economically  practicable and is hereby vested  with  all  necessary  and  appropriate  powers not inconsistent with the constitution of the United States or of  either  state, to effectuate the same, except the power to levy taxes or  assessments. It shall request the congress of the United States to  make  such appropriations for deepening and widening channels and to make such  grants of power as will enable the said plan to be effectuated. It shall  have  power  to  apply to all federal agencies, including the interstate  commerce commission, the war department, and the United States  shipping  board,  for  suitable  assistance  in  carrying  out said plan. It shall  cooperate with the state highway commissioners of  each  state  so  that  trunk line highways as and when laid out by each state shall fit in with  said  comprehensive  plan.  It  shall render such advice, suggestion and  assistance to all municipal officials  as  will  permit  all  local  and  municipal port and harbor improvements, so far as practicable, to fit in  with  said  plan.  All  municipalities  within  the  district are hereby  authorized and empowered to cooperate in the effectuation of said  plan,  and  are  hereby  vested  with  such  powers  as  may  be appropriate or  necessary so to cooperate. The bonds or other securities issued  by  the  port authority shall at all times be free from taxation by either state.  The  port  authority  shall  be  regarded  as  the  municipal  corporate  instrumentality of the two states for the purpose of developing the port  and effectuating the pledge of the states in the said  compact,  but  it  shall  have  no  power to pledge the credit of either state or to impose  any obligation upon either state, or upon any  municipality,  except  as  and  when  such power is expressly granted by statute, or the consent by  any such municipality is given.     9. The sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000),  or  so  much  thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated out of any moneys in  the  state  treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the expenses of the  port authority. The moneys hereby appropriated shall be paid out by  the  state  treasurer on the warrant of the comptroller upon vouchers audited  by the chairman of the port authority.     10. All acts and parts of  acts  inconsistent  herewith  are  hereby  repealed, and this act shall take effect immediately.      11.  To facilitate the determination of the economic practicability  of any step in the said comprehensive plan, or  of  any  other  fact  or  matter which the port authority is authorized and empowered to decide or  determine,  the  port authority may conduct investigations, inquiries or  hearings at such place or places and at such times as it shall  appoint.  Such  investigations, inquiries or hearings may be held by or before one  or more of the commissioners of the port authority, or by or before  any  person  or  persons  appointed as its representative, and when ratified,  approved or confirmed by the port authority on its action shall  be  and  be  deemed  to  be  the  investigation,  inquiry  or hearing of the port  authority.    For the purpose of such investigations, inquiries or hearings, and  of  such  other  action or powers as the port authority may be authorized or  empowered to take or exercise, it shall have jurisdiction of any and all  persons, associations,  or  corporations,  residing  in,  or  acting  or  existing under or by virtue of the laws of, or owning property or coming  within this state.      12.  Attendance  of  witness  and production of documents. The port  authority shall have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses and  the  production  of  any  papers,  books  or  other  documents,  and  to  administer  oaths  to  all  witnesses  who  may  be  called  before  it.  Subpoenas issued by the port authority shall be signed by a commissioner  or by the secretary of the port authority. No witness subpoenaed at  the  instance  of  parties other than the port authority shall be entitled to  compensation  therefrom  for  attendance or travel, but the cost thereof  shall be borne by the party at whose instance the witness  is  summoned,  unless the port authority otherwise orders. A subpoena issued under this  section shall be regulated by the civil practice law and rules.      13. 1. All hearings before the port authority, including the taking  of testimony, shall be governed by rules to be adopted and prescribed by  it.    2. In any investigation, inquiry or hearing before the port authority,  a commissioner or an officer conducting the  investigation,  inquiry  or  hearing may confer immunity in accordance with the provisions of section  50.20 of the criminal procedure law.    3. No commissioner or employee of the port authority shall be required  to give testimony in any civil suit to which the port authority is not a  party with regard to information obtained by him in the discharge of his  official duty.      14.  Every  order  of the port authority shall be served upon every  person, association or corporation to be  affected  thereby,  either  by  personal delivery of a certified copy thereof, or by mailing a certified  copy thereof, in a sealed package with postage prepaid, to the person to  be  affected  thereby; or in the case of a corporation to any officer or  agent thereof upon whom a summons might  be  served,  either  within  or  without the state, in accordance with law. It shall be the duty of every  person,  association  or  corporation,  to  notify  the  port  authority  forthwith, in writing, of the receipt of the  certified  copy  of  every  order so served, and in the case of a corporation such notification must  be signed and acknowledged by a person or officer duly authorized by the  corporation  to admit such service. Within a time specified in the order  of the port authority, such person,  association  or  corporation,  upon  whom  it  is  served, must, if so required in the order, notify the port  authority in like manner whether the terms of the order are accepted and  will be obeyed. Every order of the port authority shall take effect at a  time therein specified and shall continue in force either for  a  period  which  may  be  designated therein, or until changed or abrogated by the  port authority, unless such order be  unauthorized  by  law,  or  be  in  violation  of  a  provision  of the constitution of the state, or of the  United States.    No order staying or suspending an order of the port authority shall be  made by any court otherwise than upon notice and after hearing,  and  if  the  order  of the port authority is suspended, the order suspending the  same shall contain a specific finding based upon evidence  submitted  to  the court and identified by reference thereto that great and irreparable  damage  would  otherwise  result  to  the  petitioner and specifying the  nature of the damage.     15. Whenever the port authority shall be of  the  opinion  that  any  person,  association  or  corporation  subject  to  its  jurisdiction is  failing or omitting, or about to fail or omit to do anything required of  it by the laws governing the development and regulation of the  port  of  New  York,  or  by its order, or is doing or is about to do anything, or  permitting, or about to permit anything to be done contrary  to,  or  in  violation   of,   such   law  or  orders,  it  shall  direct  its  legal  representative to commence an action or proceeding in the  name  of  the  port  authority,  in  an  appropriate court having jurisdiction, for the  purpose of having such violations, or threatened violations, stopped and  prevented either by mandamus or injunction. Such an action or proceeding  may be brought in the supreme court of this state, and  the  said  court  shall   have   and   is  hereby  given  the  necessary  and  appropriate  jurisdiction to grant mandamus or injunction, as the case  may  require,  or any other relief appropriate to the case.    Failure  of such person, association or corporation to notify the port  authority, as required in the preceding section, of  its  acceptance  of  and  willingness to obey any order of the port authority shall be and be  deemed to  be  prima  facie  proof  that  such  person,  association  or  corporation  is  guilty  of such violation, or threatened violation. The  legal representative of the port authority shall begin  such  action  or  proceeding  by  a  petition  to  the  appropriate  court,  alleging  the  violation complained of and praying for appropriate  relief  by  way  of  mandamus  or  injunction. If the petition is directed to a court of this  state, it shall thereupon be the duty of the court to specify the  time,  not  exceeding  twenty days after the service of a copy of the petition,  within which the person, association or corporation complained  of  must  answer  the petition. In case of default in answer, or after answer, the  court shall immediately inquire into the  facts  and  circumstances,  in  such manner as the court shall direct, without other or formal pleadings  and  without  respect  to any technical requirement. Such other persons,  associations or corporations as the court shall deem necessary or proper  to join as parties, in order  to  make  its  order,  judgment  or  writs  effective,  may  be  joined  as  parties  upon  application of the legal  representative of the port authority. The final  judgment  in  any  such  action  or  proceeding shall either dismiss the action or proceeding, or  direct that a writ of mandamus, or an  injunction,  or  both,  issue  as  prayed  for  in  the  petition, or in such modified or other form as the  court may determine will afford the appropriate relief.     16. Whenever the port authority, after opportunity  to  the  parties  affected or to be affected thereby to be heard, shall determine any fact  or  matter  which  it  is authorized by any law to hear or determine, or  that any step in the effectuation of the comprehensive plan is or in the  near future will be economically practicable, it shall make its findings  in writing, setting forth its reasons therefor, and such findings  shall  be  and be deemed to be a determination by the port authority, under and  pursuant to law. Upon such determination an  appropriate  order  may  be  entered  by the port authority and be made effective and may be enforced  as herein provided.    If such findings or determination shall require the  use  of  existing  facilities  or  any part thereof described in the law, owned or operated  by any carrier or carriers,  then  the  port  authority  may  order  and  require  the  carrier  or  carriers  owning  or  operating said railroad  facilities or part thereof to permit the use of such facilities or  part  thereof  upon  the  payment  of reasonable compensation therefor. If the  carrier or carriers affected or to be affected by such order  shall  not  be  able,  within  the  time  to  be  specified in its order by the port  authority, to agree among themselves upon the compensation to be paid by  a user to a  proprietor  or  operator  for  the  use  of  such  existing  facilities   or  part  thereof,  then  the  port  authority  shall  make  determination of the amount to be paid by the user  to  the  proprietary  carrier  or  carriers,  taking  all  the  facts  and  circumstances into  account, including the public use to which  such  facilities  have  been  put;  or,  at  its  option,  the port authority may apply to the supreme  court of this state, either in a separate proceeding or  in  proceedings  by mandamus or injunction to enforce its order, to fix and determine the  fair  and  reasonable  compensation  to  be  paid  by  the  user  to the  proprietary carrier or carriers for such use. If any  carrier  shall  be  dissatisfied  with  the  findings of the port authority in the matter of  the compensation to be paid for the use of  any  existing  facility,  it  shall  have  the  right  to review the same in the supreme court of this  state by taking appropriate proceedings for  such  review  within  sixty  days  from  the  service of the order of the port authority, but pending  such review the order for the use of such facilities shall be operative,  the determination of the compensation by the court to relate back to the  time  of  the commencement of such user, unless the court shall for good  and proper reasons enjoin the operation of such order.    If, in the determination of  steps  to  effectuate  the  comprehensive  plan, the port authority shall determine that one or more union terminal  stations  are  then, or in the near future, economically practicable, it  shall call a conference of all the carriers affected or to  be  affected  by the use of such terminal stations or station and shall submit to them  a  plan  or plans for the construction, maintenance and use thereof.  If  the carriers or any of them shall fail or  refuse  to  agree  upon  such  plan,  the  port  authority  shall  make  and  certify  its findings and  conclusions to the supreme court of this state, and the  said  court  is  vested  with  appropriate and adequate jurisdiction to determine whether  or not such plan or plans for a union station or stations effectuate the  comprehensive plan, and to make such conditions and impose such terms as  will carry out the same in accordance with the  principles  embraced  in  the comprehensive plan and the laws governing the same.     17.

Legislative findings.          2. Short title.          3. Definitions.          4. Regional pilot projects for the uninsured.     Section  1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that there are  more than two and one-half million residents of the state  who  have  no  health  care  coverage.  The  legislature recognizes that since nineteen  hundred eighty  the  number  of  state  residents  without  health  care  coverage  has  increased  at a rate of one hundred thousand per year, an  increase of more than thirty percent in six years.    The legislature further finds that people without health care coverage  have limited access to primary health care services and  tend  to  defer  obtaining medical care, which leads to increased severity of illness and  increased  costs  when services are utilized. The legislature recognizes  that the lack of health care coverage has serious implications  for  the  overall health status of residents of the state.    The  legislature  recognizes  the need to develop methods of providing  health care coverage to uninsured individuals and families in  order  to  improve  the health of residents of New York. Therefore, the legislature  hereby declares that it is the policy  of  this  state  to  promote  the  establishment  of pilot programs to test effective mechanisms to provide  health care coverage to the uninsured. The legislature further  declares  that   these  pilot  programs  will  provide  valuable  information  for  determining  future  methods  of  providing  comprehensive  health  care  coverage to all New York residents who lack such coverage.      2.

The commissioner shall  approve  at least one of each program in accordance with subdivision five of this  section. In the absence of applications which meet the approval criteria  for  any  one model, the commissioner may approve additional programs in  the other program category.    2. (a) An individual subsidy  program  shall  assist  individuals  and  families   in   purchasing  health  care  coverage  under  insurance  or  equivalent  coverage  mechanisms.  In   order   to   be   eligible   for  participation  in  the program, and subject to annual recertification of  eligibility, individuals and families shall meet the following criteria:    (i) gross household income is at or below two hundred percent  of  the  non-farm federal poverty level; and    (ii)  not  receiving  medical  assistance  without taking into account  costs incurred for medical care under the provisions  of  section  three  hundred sixty-six of the social services law; and    (iii)  ineligible  for  medicare as defined in subchapter XVIII of the  federal Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., and    (iv) do not have equivalent health care coverage  under  insurance  or  equivalent  coverage  mechanisms  as  defined  by  the  commissioner, in  consultation with the superintendent. Individuals  and  families  having  health  care  coverage  within the six month period prior to application  shall not be eligible for the individual subsidy program. The limitation  shall not apply to persons who become ineligible for medical  assistance  or  whose  insurance or equivalent coverage is terminated as a result of  loss of employment within such period.    (b)  If  individuals  and  families  receiving  benefits   under   the  individual  subsidy  program  become  eligible for medical assistance by  taking into account costs incurred for  medical  care,  social  services  districts  may  pay  all  or  part  of  the  premium  in accordance with  department of social services  regulations.  For  the  purpose  of  this  paragraph, subsidy payments shall not be available to cover the costs of  the premium.    (c)  For  the  purposes  of  the  individual  subsidy program, subsidy  payments shall be made, under subdivision eight of this section,  to  an  approved  organization  for  the  purpose  of reducing premium payments,  deductibles  or  copayments  for  participants  in  the   program.   The  commissioner  may  establish and adjust schedules of payments to be made  under this program. In determining such schedules, the costs to be borne  by the individual or family shall take into account the  household  size  and  gross  annual income of the household and such other factors as the  commissioner may deem appropriate.    (d)   Notwithstanding   the   provisions  of  paragraph  (a)  of  this  subdivision, an individual who meets  the  criteria  as  established  in  subparagraphs (ii) through (iv) of such paragraph may be enrolled in the  individual   subsidy   program,   provided  however,  that  an  approved  organization shall not be eligible to  receive  a  subsidy  payment  for  providing coverage to such an individual. Enrollment of such individuals  shall  not  exceed  twenty-five  percent  of  the  total  enrollment for  participants in the individual subsidy program.    (e) Applications for enrollment in the individual subsidy program will  not be accepted on and after January first, two thousand one;  provided,  however,  individuals and families who are otherwise eligible to receive  benefits under such program and are enrolled prior to January first, two  thousand  one,  may  remain  enrolled  in  such  program   until   March  thirty-first, two thousand nine.    3.  (a) An employer incentive program shall assist employers of twenty  or fewer employees in purchasing health care coverage for all  full-time  employees  and  such other employees determined to be qualified for such  coverage by the  employer  based  on  employment  status.  In  order  to  participate  in  the program, an employer shall not have, within the six  month period prior  to  application,  provided  employer-financed  group  health  care  coverage  to  any  employee associated with the employer's  business.    (b) An employer incentive payment shall  consist  of  payments  to  an  approved organization in the amount of no more than fifty percent of the  premium  costs  for  group  health care coverage for employees and their  dependents. Employees shall not be required to make contributions to the  payment of premium costs under this program. Premium costs  incurred  by  an  employer  for  group  health  insurance  coverage  for  officers and  directors of an employer and others  with  a  proprietary  or  ownership  interest  in  the  employer  may be eligible for an incentive payment to  offset premium costs; provided, however, that the gross household income  of such officers and directors or others with a propriety  or  ownership  interest  does  not  exceed the limits provided pursuant to subparagraph  (i) of paragraph (a) of subdivision two of  this  section  and  provided  further  that  one or more employees and their dependents proposed to be  covered by such  group  health  care  coverage  are  unrelated  to  such  officers,  directors  or  other  persons  with  a propriety or ownership  interest. If an employer participating in an employer incentive  program  hires more than twenty employees after joining the program, the employer  may  continue  in  the program but the premium costs attributable to the  additional employees  or  their  families  shall  not  be  eligible  for  incentive payments.    (c) Employers may be approved to participate in the program based upon  the  average  salaries  of  the employees who are to receive health care  coverage, with those employers with the lowest average employee salaries  to  be  selected  first  and  other  employers  to   be   eligible   for  participation as funding will allow.    (d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, if the number  of employers who meet the criteria established in paragraph (a) of  this  subdivision,  and  who  are  applying  for participation in the employer  subsidy program, exceeds the amount of funds available  to  an  approved  organization  to  provide  health  care  coverage to employers under the  program, the approved organization may enroll additional employers.  The  approved  organization  shall  not  receive  incentive payments for such  employers. Enrollment of such employers  shall  not  exceed  twenty-five  percent  of  the  total  enrollment  of  employers  and their dependents  participating in the employer incentive program.    (e)  Employer  incentive programs established pursuant to this section  shall expire upon implementation of the New York  state  small  business  health  insurance  partnership program in accordance with the provisions  of article 9-A of the public health law.    4. The commissioner shall establish guidelines for the  submission  of  proposals  by eligible organizations, including, but not limited to, the  following components:    (i) standards for premiums, copayments and deductibles which  consider  the needs of program participants in obtaining health care;    (ii)  insurance or equivalent coverage mechanisms to be utilized under  the project;    (iii) minimum standards for benefits under  the  requirements  of  the  insurance law and such additional benefits as may be identified;    (iv) health care provider payment methodologies;    (v)  appropriate  utilization review and quality assurance mechanisms;  and    (vi) such other criteria which may be deemed necessary.    5.

(b)  The  commissioner, within forty-five days of receiving a proposal  from an eligible entity, shall make a determination whether to  approve,  disapprove  or  recommend  modification  of the proposal. In order for a  proposal to be approved by the commissioner, the proposal must  also  be  approved  by  the  superintendent  with  respect  to  the  provisions of  subparagraphs (xii) through (xiv) of paragraph (a) of this  subdivision.  Upon  receiving a proposal, the commissioner shall provide a copy of the  proposal  to  the  chairman  of  the  subcommittee,  consult  with   the  subcommittee   and  receive  its  recommendation  with  regard  to  such  application.    6. The  commissioner,  in  consultation  with  the  subcommittee,  may  approve  a  supplemental  grant  program,  in addition to those programs  authorized under subdivision five of this section, to provide grants for  public  education,  outreach  and  marketing  of  health  care  coverage  targeted  at  uninsured  individuals  and  families  and  employers  not  providing coverage to their employees in any geographic  area  which  is  not  designated for regional pilot project implementation. Grants may be  used for the following:    (i) public  education  concerning  the  availability  of  health  care  coverage;    (ii)  promotion  of community awareness of the benefits of health care  coverage; and    (iii) outreach and direct recruitment of potential enrollees.    7. The commissioner is authorized  to  approve  contracts  between  an  approved  organization  and  any  other  organization  for  the purposes  including, but not  limited  to,  outreach,  marketing  and  eligibility  determination.    8.  The  commissioner  shall  determine  the  amount  of  funds  to be  allocated to an approved organization  for  the  purposes  described  in  subdivision  one  of  this  section from any funds available pursuant to  subparagraph (i) of paragraph (f) of  subdivision  nineteen  of  section  twenty-eight hundred seven-c of the public health law.    8-a.  The  commissioner,  in consultation with the superintendent, may  adjust subsidy payments and incentive payments for approved programs for  any of the following circumstances: (a) for new programs;  (b)  for  new  coverage  under  existing  programs; and (c) to be effective on the next  annual renewal date of the affected coverage for existing coverage.    9. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of subdivision  two  of  section two thousand eight hundred seven-c of the public health law,  approved organizations may enter into agreements for negotiated  payment  rate  methodologies  with general hospitals for inpatient and outpatient  hospital services. Such negotiated payment  rate  methodologies  in  the  case  of  inpatient  services or outpatient services shall be subject to  the approval of the commissioner, and shall not adversely affect quality  of care outcomes or  result  in  the  shifting  of  costs  of  providing  services to beneficiaries of a program to any other payor.    10.  An approved organization shall submit reports to the commissioner  in such form and at times as may be required in order  to  evaluate  the  operations and results of such program.    11.  The  commissioner,  in  consultation with the subcommittee, shall  enter  into  agreements  with  one  or  more   persons,   not-for-profit  corporations,  or  other  organizations,  other  than  a state employee,  official or agency, for the performance of a comprehensive evaluation of  the implementation and effectiveness  of  the  regional  pilot  projects  authorized  pursuant  to  this  act. The evaluation shall assess factors  including, but not limited to:    (i) the overall effect of the regional pilot projects on access to and  utilization of health care services;    (ii) the impact of the regional pilot projects on the health status of  program participants;    (iii)   the   impact  of  using  a  negotiated  special  payment  rate  methodology on  access  to  and  quality  of  inpatient  and  outpatient  services  delivered  by general hospitals and on the functioning of such  hospitals;    (iv) the impact of using alternative insurance, financing, health care  delivery and provider  payment  models  on  the  costs  of  health  care  coverage;    (v)  the  impact  of  the  regional pilot projects on the bad debt and  charity care system and on other insurers, employment  and  health  care  delivery systems in the regional pilot project location;    (vi)  the feasibility and appropriateness of implementing the regional  pilot projects in other locations and on a statewide basis; and    (vii) the impact on the regional pilot projects of any  adjustment  of  subsidy payments or incentive payments.    An  evaluation required pursuant to this section shall be submitted to  the governor and the legislature by April 1, 1995.    12. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of section 112  or  163  of  the  state  finance  law  or any other law, at the discretion of the  commissioner without a competitive bid or request for proposal  process,  contractual  arrangements  with approved organizations in effect in 1993  may be extended through December 31, 1999 to  provide  an  uninterrupted  continuation of services and may be amended as may be necessary."

The board may delegate to one or more of its officers, employees or  agents, such powers and duties as the board may deem proper, except  any  duties  inconsistent  with  the  duties  and functions prescribed by any  other office or position any such person may hold.      8.  Functions of the board. 1. In carrying out the purposes of this  act, the board shall perform the following functions:    a. As set forth in section nine of  this  act,  the  board  shall  (i)  consult  with  the city and the covered organizations in the preparation  of the financial plan, and certify to the  city  the  revenue  estimates  approved  therein, (ii) prescribe the form of the financial plan and the  supporting information  required  in  connection  therewith,  and  (iii)  exercise  the  rights  of  approval,  disapproval  and modification with  respect to the financial plan, including but not limited to the  revenue  estimates contained therein.    b.  As set forth in section ten of this act, the board shall establish  and adopt procedures with respect to the deposit of revenues of the city  and the covered organizations in the fund and the disbursement of moneys  from the fund.    c. The board shall, from time to time  and  to  the  extent  it  deems  necessary  or desirable in order to accomplish the purposes of this act,  (i) review the operations, management, efficiency  and  productivity  of  such  city  operations  and  of  such  covered organizations or portions  thereof as the board may determine, and make reports thereon; (ii) audit  compliance with the financial plan  in  such  areas  as  the  board  may  determine;  (iii)  recommend  to  the city and the covered organizations  such measures relating to their operations, management,  efficiency  and  productivity  as  it  deems  appropriate  to  reduce  costs  and improve  services so as to advance the purposes of  this  act;  and  (iv)  obtain  information  on  the  financial  condition and needs of the city and the  covered organizations. Nothing herein shall diminish the powers  of  the  comptroller  otherwise  provided  by  law  and the board may request the  assistance of the comptroller in the performance of the above functions.    d. The  board  shall  (i)  receive  from  the  city  and  the  covered  organizations  and  from  the  comptroller,  and  review, such financial  statements  and  projections,  budgetary  data  and   information,   and  management  reports  and  materials  as  the  board  deems  necessary or  desirable to accomplish the purposes of this act, and (ii) inspect, copy  and  audit  such  books  and  records  of  the  city  and  the   covered  organizations  as  the  board deems necessary or desirable to accomplish  the purposes of this act.    e. All contracts entered into by the city or any covered  organization  must  be consistent with the provisions of this act and must comply with  the requirements of the financial plan as approved by  the  board.  With  respect  to all contracts or other obligations to be entered into by the  city or any covered  organization  after  May  first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-four, requiring the payment of funds or the incurring of costs by  the city or any covered organization:    (i)  Within  twenty  days  from  May  2,  1984, the city manager shall  present to the board proposed regulations respecting the categories  and  types  of contracts and other obligations required to be reviewed by the  board pursuant to this subdivision. Within thirty days from May 2, 1984,  the board shall approve or modify and approve such proposed  regulations  or  promulgate  its  own in the event that such proposed regulations are  not submitted to it within the twenty days as provided for herein.  Such  regulation  may thereafter be modified by the board from time to time on  not less than thirty days notice  to  the  city  manager  on  or  before  December  31,  1991 and thereafter to the mayor and the city manager, or  mayor, respectively, may from time to time propose modifications to  the  board.  Unless  expressly  disapproved  or  modified by the board within  thirty days from the date of submission by the city  manager  or  mayor,  any  such proposed regulations or modifications shall be deemed approved  by the board;    (ii)  Prior  to entering into any contract or other obligation subject  to review of the board under its regulations, the city  or  any  covered  organization shall submit a copy of such contract or other obligation to  the  board  accompanied  by  an  analysis of the projected costs of such  contract or  other  obligation  and  a  certification  that  performance  thereof  will be in accordance with the financial plan, all in such form  and with such additional information as the  board  may  prescribe.  The  board  shall  promptly  review  the  terms  of  such  contract  or other  obligation  and  the  supporting  information  in  order  to   determine  compliance with the financial plan;    (iii)  The  board  shall,  by  order, disapprove any contract or other  obligation  reviewed  by  it  only  after  enactment  of  a   resolution  determining  that,  in its judgment, the performance of such contract or  other obligation would be inconsistent with the financial plan, and upon  such order the city or covered organization shall not  enter  into  such  contract or other obligation;    (iv)  If  the board approves the terms of a reviewed contract or other  obligation, the  city  or  covered  organization  may  enter  into  such  contract  or  other  obligation  upon  the terms submitted to the board.  Failure of the board to notify the city or covered  organization  within  thirty  days (or such additional time, not exceeding thirty days, as the  board shall have notified the  city  or  covered  organization  that  it  requires  to complete its review and analysis) after submission to it of  a contract or other obligation that such contract  or  other  obligation  has  been  disapproved  shall  be  deemed  to  constitute board approval  thereof.    f. The board shall review the terms of  each  proposed  long-term  and  short-term  borrowing  by  the  city  and any covered organization to be  effected during the emergency period after May first,  nineteen  hundred  eighty-four, and no such borrowing shall be made unless it complies with  the  provisions  of the special fiscal act and is approved by the board.  The board shall consult and coordinate with the comptroller with respect  to the borrowings of the city and any  covered  organization  and  shall  receive  reports from the comptroller on his review of borrowings by the  city. No covered organization shall be prohibited from issuing bonds  or  notes to pay outstanding bonds or notes.    g.  The  board  shall  receive  quarterly reports from the comptroller  setting forth the debt service requirements on all bonds  and  notes  of  the city and covered organizations for the following quarter.    h.  The board shall issue, to the appropriate official of the city and  the  covered  organization,  such  orders  as  it  deems  necessary   to  accomplish  the  purposes  of  this  act,  including but not limited to,  timely and satisfactory implementation of an  approved  financial  plan.  Any  order  so  issued shall be binding upon the official to whom it was  issued and failure to comply with such order shall subject the  official  to the penalties described in section twelve of this act.    i. The board shall coordinate with the comptroller with respect to the  performance   of   its   review  and  monitoring  of  the  revenues  and  expenditures of the city and covered organizations.    2. In carrying out its functions under this act, including making  its  determination  whether  to  approve  or  disapprove  a financial plan or  financial  plan  modification  of  the  city,  the  board  shall  ensure  compliance  by  the  city  with  the requirements imposed by the special  fiscal act, and all the requirements  of  such  act  shall  apply  to  a  financial  plan  of  the  city.  Nothing  contained in this act shall be  construed to amend, repeal, be inconsistent with, less stringent or less  restrictive than the special  fiscal  act.  If  any  inconsistencies  or  conflicts  between this act and the special fiscal act shall result from  the operations of the board or otherwise, the provisions of the  special  fiscal  act  shall  control  as  provided  in subdivision (F) of section  fourteen of the special fiscal act.    3. a. Notwithstanding  the  provisions  or  limitations  of  any  law,  general, special or local, including the charter of the city of Yonkers,  an  impasse panel, arbitrator, collective bargaining board, fact finding  or similar type of panel, body or  individual  which  is  authorized  to  recommend  or  award  an  increase  in  wages  or fringe benefits to any  employee of the city or  covered  organization  shall,  in  addition  to  considering  any  standard  or  factor  required  to  be  considered  by  applicable law, also take  into  consideration  and  accord  substantial  weight  to  the financial ability of the city or covered organization to  pay the cost of such increase in wages or fringe benefits.    b. Any determination pursuant to article eight of the labor law or any  agreement or stipulation entered into in lieu thereof which provides for  an increase in wages or fringe benefits of any employee of the  city  or  covered  organization  shall, in addition to considering any standard or  factor required to be considered  by  applicable  law,  also  take  into  consideration  and accord substantial weight to the financial ability of  the city or covered organization to pay the cost  of  such  increase  in  wages or fringe benefits.    c.  Any  party  to  a proceeding before a panel, body or individual as  described in paragraph a or b of this subdivision may commence a special  proceeding in the appellate division, second department, supreme  court,  state of New York, to review the determination as to the city or covered  organization's  financial  ability  to  pay.  Such  proceeding  shall be  commenced not later than thirty days after the final  determination  has  been  made  by the panel, body or individual. Such proceeding shall have  preference over all other cases in such appellate division,  other  than  cases relating to the election law.    d.  The court shall make a de novo review of the record solely for the  purpose of determining whether an award  of  an  increase  in  wages  or  fringe   benefits  was  within  the  city's  or  covered  organization's  financial ability to pay. The court's findings as to such issue shall be  based upon a preponderance of all the evidence set forth in the  record.  Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, arguments or submission shall be  had within fifteen days after commencement of the special proceeding and  the  court shall render its decision within fifteen days thereafter. All  questions, other than the question relating to the determination,  shall  be  reviewed  by  the  appellate  division in the same proceeding in the  manner provided by article seventy-five or seventy-eight  of  the  civil  practice  law  and rules as may be appropriate, notwithstanding that the  issue would otherwise have been cognizable in the first instance  before  a  special  or  trial  term  of  the  supreme  court. If an appeal shall  otherwise lie from such determination of the appellate division  to  the  court  of  appeals,  notice  of such appeal shall be filed within thirty  days after the entry of the final order or  judgment  of  the  appellate  division if such appeal is of right or within ten days after entry of an  order  granting  leave  to appeal, and such appeal shall have preference  over all other appeals other than appeals relating to the election law.    e. At any stage of any proceeding under paragraph a, b or c hereof  or  any  appeal  from an order or judgment therefrom the board may intervene  as a party on the issue of the financial ability of the city or  covered  organization to pay the cost of an increase in wages or fringe benefits.    f.  For  the  purposes  of  this subdivision, financial ability to pay  shall mean the financial ability of the city or covered organization  to  pay  the  cost  of  any  increase  in  wages  or fringe benefits without  requiring an increase in the level of city  taxes  as  approved  in  the  financial  plan of the city in effect at the time of the commencement of  a proceeding under paragraph a or b hereof.      9. Development of the financial plan. 1. Pursuant to the procedures  contained in subdivision two of this section, each year the  city  shall  develop,  and  may  from  time  to time modify, with the approval of the  board, a four year financial plan covering  the  city  and  the  covered  organizations.  Each such financial plan and financial plan modification  shall conform to the requirements of subdivision three of  this  section  and  shall  (a) provide that the operating and capital funds of the city  will be balanced in accordance with the accounting system and procedures  prescribed by the comptroller pursuant  to  section  thirty-six  of  the  general  municipal  law,  and  (b)  comply  with the requirements of the  special fiscal act.    2. The financial plan shall be developed and approved,  and  may  from  time  to time be modified, with the approval of the board, in accordance  with the following procedures:    a. Commencing with  the  city's  fiscal  year  beginning  July  first,  nineteen hundred eighty-four, and not later than fifty days prior to the  beginning  of  such fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, or such  other date as the board may approve at the request of the city, the city  shall prepare and submit a financial plan to the board covering the four  year period beginning with such fiscal year. On such  dates,  the  mayor  shall also submit to the board the city's proposed operating and capital  budgets  for  the  ensuing  fiscal  year  and a certificate of the mayor  stating that  such  budgets  are  consistent  with  the  financial  plan  submitted  therewith,  that  the  budgets conform in all respects to the  requirements of the special fiscal act, and that  operation  within  the  budgets is feasible.    b.  Not more than forty-five days after submission of a financial plan  or  more  than  thirty  days  after  submission  of  a  financial   plan  modification,  the  board  shall determine whether the financial plan or  financial plan modification is complete and complies with the provisions  of subdivision one of this section and shall approve or  disapprove  the  financial  plan  or  financial  plan modification in accordance with the  provisions of this section.    c. If the board determines that the financial plan or  financial  plan  modification  is  complete  and complies with the standards set forth in  subdivision one of this section, the board shall approve  the  financial  plan or financial plan modification. Upon making such determination, the  board  shall  make  a  certification  to  the city setting forth revenue  estimates approved by the board in accordance with such determination.    d. The board shall  disapprove,  by  resolution,  the  financial  plan  proposed by the city if, in the judgment of the board, such plan:    (i) is incomplete;    (ii)  fails  to  contain projections of revenues and expenditures that  are based on reasonable  and  appropriate  assumptions  and  methods  of  estimation;    (iii)  fails  to  provide  that operations of the city and the covered  organizations will be conducted  within  the  cash  resources  available  according to the board's revenue estimates; or    (iv)  fails  to  comply with the provisions of subdivision one of this  section.    e. In disapproving a financial plan  or  financial  plan  modification  proposed   by  the  city,  the  board  may  direct  that  the  aggregate  expenditures in  any  period  be  reduced  to  conform  to  the  revenue  estimates  certified by the board to achieve the objectives set forth in  subdivision one of this section.    f.  In the event that the city shall, for any reason, fail to submit a  financial plan, as required pursuant to paragraph a of this subdivision,  or to adopt a financial plan approved by the board, or in the event that  the board has not, for any reason permitted under this act,  approved  a  financial  plan  submitted  by the city, the board, after enactment of a  resolution so finding, shall formulate and adopt a financial plan to  be  effective  until  the  board  approves a financial plan submitted by the  city. All budgets and operations of the city or a  covered  organization  shall  be  in conformance and compliance with the financial plan then in  effect.    g. After the initial adoption  of  the  financial  plan,  the  revenue  estimates  certified  by  the  board  and  the  financial  plan shall be  regularly reexamined by the board in consultation with the city and  the  covered  organizations  and  the city shall provide a modified financial  plan in such detail and  within  such  time  period  as  the  board  may  require. In the event of reductions in such revenue estimates, or in the  event  the  city  or a covered organization shall expend funds at a rate  that would exceed the aggregate expenditure limitation for the  city  or  covered  organization  prior  to  the expiration of the fiscal year, the  city  shall  submit  a  financial  plan  modification  to  effect   such  adjustments in revenue estimates and reductions in total expenditures as  may  be  necessary  to  conform  to  such  revised  revenue estimates or  aggregate expenditure limitations. If, within a time period specified by  the board, the city fails to make such modifications after reductions in  revenue estimates, or to provide a modified plan in  detail  and  within  such  time period required by the board, the board, after enactment of a  resolution so finding, may formulate and adopt such modifications to the  financial  plan,  such  modifications  to  become  effective  on   their  adoption.    h.   The   city   may,  from  time  to  time,  submit  financial  plan  modifications for review by the board.  The  board  shall  approve  such  modifications  unless,  in the judgment of the board, such modifications  would constitute grounds for disapproval of a financial plan pursuant to  paragraph d of this subdivision.    3. The financial plan shall be in such form  and  shall  contain  such  information  for  each year during which the financial plan is in effect  as the board may specify, shall include the city  and  all  the  covered  organizations,  and  shall, in such detail as the board may from time to  time prescribe, include statements of all estimated revenues and of  all  expenditures  and  cash  flow  projections  of  the city and each of the  covered organizations.    4. The financial plan shall, except to the extent waived by the  board  with  respect  to  any limited period, include any information which the  board may request  to  satisfy  itself  that  (i)  projected  employment  levels,  collective  bargaining  agreements and other action relating to  employee costs, capital construction and such other matters as the board  may  specify,  are  consistent  with  the  provisions  made   for   such  obligations  in  the  financial  plan,  (ii)  the  city  and the covered  organizations are taking whatever action is necessary  with  respect  to  programs  mandated  by state and federal law to ensure that expenditures  for such programs are limited to and covered by the expenditures  stated  in  the  financial  plan,  and  (iii)  adequate reserves are provided to  maintain  essential  programs  in   the   event   revenues   have   been  overestimated or expenditures underestimated for any period.    5.  For  each  financial  plan  and  financial plan modification to be  prepared and submitted  by  the  city  to  the  board  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  this  section, the covered organizations shall submit to  the city such information with respect to their projected  expenditures,  revenues  and cash flows for each year covered by such financial plan or  modification  as  the  city  shall  determine. Notwithstanding any other  provision of law limiting the authority of the city with respect to  any  covered organization, the city, in the preparation and submission of the  financial plan and modifications thereof, shall (except for debt service  or  for  other  expenditures  to  the  extent that such expenditures are  required by law) have the power to determine the aggregate  expenditures  to  be  allocated  to any covered organization in the financial plan and  any modifications thereto.     10. Establishment and application  of  emergency  financial  control  board  fund  for  the  city of Yonkers. 1. There is hereby established a  fund designated the emergency financial control board fund for the  city  of  Yonkers.  Commencing  on the effective date of the initial financial  plan approved by the board and for the duration of the emergency period,  all revenues received or to be received  by  the  city  or  any  covered  organization  shall,  unless  exempted  by  order of the board or to the  extent otherwise required by the special fiscal act, be revenues of  the  fund  and  shall  be  for  the  account  of the city and the appropriate  covered organizations, but disbursement from the fund shall be  made  by  the  board in accordance with the approved financial plan, except to the  extent  otherwise  required  by  the  special  fiscal   act,   expressly  prohibited  by  federal  law  or  where such revenues are pledged to the  payment of any outstanding bonds, notes or other obligations of  covered  organizations.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board shall authorize  the city to make all disbursements of city revenues from the board fund,  which disbursements shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  approved  financial plan; provided, that the board may withdraw such authorization  if  it  determines  that (a) any disbursements made or to be made by the  city have not been or are likely  not  to  be  in  compliance  with  the  approved  financial plan, (b) the city has violated any other provisions  of this act or the special fiscal act, or (c) the city has  violated  an  agreement  with  any holder or guarantor of bonds or notes issued by the  city or a state financing agency. Commencing on the  effective  date  of  the  initial  financial plan approved by the board, and for the duration  of  the  emergency  period,  all  funds  and  accounts  established   or  thereafter  established  by the city of the covered organizations shall,  unless exempted by order of the board, thereafter be funds and  accounts  of  the  fund  except  to  the  extent otherwise required by the special  fiscal act, expressly  prohibited  by  federal  law  or  to  the  extent  prohibited by covenants or agreements relating to any outstanding bonds,  notes  or  other obligations of covered organizations. All such accounts  of the board shall have such captions and entries  as  the  board  shall  determine  to be necessary to credit the foregoing revenues and receipts  to the fund. The moneys of the fund shall not be deemed to be  money  of  the state or money under its control.    2. The deposit of revenues into the fund and the investment or deposit  of  moneys  therein  shall  be  made  in accordance with and pursuant to  procedures established by the board and the special fiscal act.    3. In order to assure compliance with the financial  plan,  the  board  shall from time to time adopt procedures controlling the disbursement of  moneys from the fund.    4.  If  at  any time the board determines that the amount then held in  the fund or the amount estimated by the board to be held in the fund  is  or  will  be insufficient to meet the expenditures in the amounts and at  the times required by  the  financial  plan,  the  board  shall  require  disbursements  from  the  fund  to  be  made  in  the following order or  priority unless otherwise required  by  law  of  the  United  States  of  America:  (i)  the  payment  of amounts from the fund to comply with the  provisions of  the  special  fiscal  act,  (ii)  the  payment  of  other  liabilities  having  statutory  or  contractual  priority over remaining  liabilities of the city and the covered organizations whose  moneys  are  included  in  the fund, and (iii) the payment of other obligations on an  allocated basis as specified by the city for expenditures in  accordance  with  the financial plan provided that, in the event that the city fails  to so specify, the board may withhold  payment  of  any  of  such  other  obligations or may direct their payment pro rata.    5. The board shall cause to be performed such pre-audit and post-audit  reviews of the fund and disbursements therefrom as it may determine.      11.  Authorization  for wage freeze. 1. Upon a finding by the board  that a wage freeze is essential to the adoption or maintenance of a city  budget that is in compliance with this act, the board,  after  enactment  of  a  resolution  so  finding, may declare a fiscal crisis. Upon making  such a declaration, the board shall  be  empowered  to  order  that  all  increases  in  salary or wages of employees of the city and employees of  covered organizations which will take effect after the date of the order  pursuant  to  collective  bargaining  agreements  or   other   analogous  contracts,  now  in  existence or hereafter entered into, requiring such  salary increases as of any date thereafter are suspended. Such order may  also provide that  all  increased  payments  for  holiday  and  vacation  differentials, shift differentials, salary adjustments according to plan  and  step-ups  or  increments for employees of the city and employees of  covered organizations which will take effect after the date of the order  pursuant  to  collective  bargaining  agreements  or   other   analogous  contracts  requiring  such  increased payments as of any date thereafter  are, in the same manner, suspended. For the purposes  of  computing  the  pension  base  of  retirement  allowances,  any suspended salary or wage  increases and any suspended other payments shall not  be  considered  as  part of compensation or final compensation or of annual salary earned or  earnable.  The suspensions authorized hereunder shall continue until one  year after the date of the order and, to the extent of any determination  of the board  that  a  continuation  of  such  suspensions,  to  a  date  specified  by the board, is necessary in order to achieve the objectives  of the financial plan, such suspensions shall be continued to  the  date  specified  by such board, which date shall in no event be later than the  end of the  emergency  period,  provided  that  such  suspensions  shall  terminate  with  respect  to  employees who have agreed to a deferral of  salary or wage increase upon the certification of the agreement  by  the  board pursuant to subdivision two of this section.    2.  This  section  shall not be applicable to employees of the city or  employees of a covered organization covered by a  collective  bargaining  agreement  or  an  employee  of  the  city or a covered organization not  covered by  a  collective  bargaining  agreement  where  the  collective  bargaining representative or such unrepresented employee has agreed to a  deferment  of salary or wage increase, by an instrument in writing which  has been certified by the board as being an acceptable  and  appropriate  contribution  toward alleviating the fiscal crisis of the city. Any such  agreement to a deferment of salary or wage increase may provide that for  the purposes of computing the pension base of retirement allowances, any  deferred  salary  or  wage  increase  may  be  considered  as  part   of  compensation  or  final  compensation  or  of  annual  salary  earned or  earnable.    3. The board may,  if  it  finds  that  the  fiscal  crisis  has  been  sufficiently alleviated or for any other appropriate reason, direct that  the  suspensions  of  salary  or  wage increases or suspensions of other  increased  payments  or  benefits  shall,  in  whole  or  in  part,   be  terminated.      12.  Prohibitions; penalties. 1. During the emergency period (i) no  officer or employee of the city or of any of the  covered  organizations  shall  make  or  authorize an obligation or other liability in excess of  the amount available therefor  under  the  financial  plan  as  then  in  effect; (ii) no officer or employee of the city or of any of the covered  organizations shall involve the city or any of the covered organizations  in  any  contract  or  other  obligation or liability for the payment of  money for any purpose required to be approved by the board  unless  such  contract  has been so approved and unless such contract or obligation or  liability is in compliance with the financial plan as then in effect.    2. No  officer  or  employee  of  the  city  or  any  of  the  covered  organizations  shall  take any action in violation of any valid order of  the board or shall fail or refuse to take any  action  required  by  any  such  order  or  shall  prepare,  present  or  certify  any  information  (including any projections or estimates) or report for the board or  any  of  its  agents  that is false or misleading, or, upon learning that any  such information is false or misleading, shall fail promptly  to  advise  the board or its agents thereof.    3.  In  addition  to any penalty or liability under any other law, any  officer or employee of the city or any of the covered organizations  who  shall violate subdivision one or two of this section shall be subject to  appropriate  administrative  discipline,  including,  when circumstances  warrant, suspension from duty without pay  or  removal  from  office  by  order  of  either the governor or the mayor; and any officer or employee  of the city or any of the covered organizations who shall knowingly  and  willfully  violate  subdivision  one  or two of this section shall, upon  conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor.    4. In the case of a violation  of  subdivision  one  or  two  of  this  section  by  an  officer  or  employee of the city or any of the covered  organizations, the mayor or the chief executive officer of such  covered  organization  shall  immediately report to the board all pertinent facts  together with a statement of the action taken thereon.     13. Indemnification. 1. The state shall save harmless and  indemnify  members, officers and employees of and representatives to the board, all  of whom shall be deemed officers and employees of the state for purposes  of  section  seventeen  of  the  public officers law, against any claim,  demand, suit, or judgment arising by reason of any act  or  omission  to  act by such member, officer, employee or representative occurring in the  discharge of his duties and within the scope of his service on behalf of  such  board  including  any  claim,  demand,  suit  or judgment based on  allegations  that  financial  loss  was  sustained  by  any  person   in  connection with the acquisition, disposition or holding of securities or  other  obligations.  In  the  event  of  any such claim, demand, suit or  judgment, a member, officer or employee  of  or  representative  to  the  board  shall  be  saved  harmless  and  indemnified, notwithstanding the  limitations of subdivision  one  of  section  seventeen  of  the  public  officers  law,  unless  such  individual  is  found  by a final judicial  determination not to have acted, in good faith, for a purpose  which  he  reasonably  believed  to  be in the best interest of the board or not to  have had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful.    2. In connection with any such claim, demand, suit, or  judgment,  any  member,  officer  or employee of or representative to the board shall be  entitled to representation by private counsel of his choice in any civil  judicial proceeding whenever the attorney general determines based  upon  his  investigation and review of the facts and circumstances of the case  that representation by the attorney general would be inappropriate.

Legislative  findings and purposes. The legislature finds  that the wine/grape industry  is  a  significant  part  of  the  state's  agricultural  industry  and  that  the  continued  production  of  wine,  unfermented juice and table grapes is of significant importance  to  the  economy of the state.    The legislature further finds that in recent years economic conditions  have  had an adverse effect on the wine/grape industry, especially grape  growers,  resulting  predominately  from  an  international  surplus  of  grapes.  Such  economic  disadvantages  have included various incentives  made available by their counties to European wine producers, tariff  and  non-tariff  barriers to United States wines entering other countries and  most recently, a strong United States dollar  which  has  increased  the  price  of  all  domestic  wines  in relation to foreign wines. All these  conditions have resulted in  a  decline  in  New  York's  share  of  the  national and international wine market.    The legislature further finds and recognizes that an important step in  strengthening  the  agricultural  and  economic  potential of New York's  wine/grape industry is to  encourage  the  long  term  operation  of  an  organization,  representative  of  all sectors of the grape industry for  the purpose of conducting an extensive and coordinated  promotional  and  applied  research  program  intended to stimulate and centralize the New  York wine/grape industry.    For these purposes, there shall be created  a  non-profit  corporation  known  as  the ""New York wine/grape foundation"", which may independently  initiate promotional and research projects to fulfill  essential  public  purposes  which  are necessary for the health, safety and welfare of the  people of this state.     2. New York wine/grape foundation. 1.  There  is  hereby  created  a  non-profit  corporation which shall be known as the ""New York wine/grape  foundation"". Such foundation shall be  governed  by  the  not-for-profit  corporation  law except where such law conflicts with this act, in which  case the provisions of this act shall govern.    2. The  foundation  is  created  to  fulfill  the  public  purpose  of  providing for an effective and continuous program of research, promotion  and  education  to  strengthen  the  New  York wine and grape industry's  position in the marketplace including the maintenance and  expansion  of  domestic  and  foreign  markets  and uses for grapes grown and processed  within the state.     3. Purposes and powers. 1. The foundation is authorized and directed  to plan and provide for the implementation of programs to:    (a) Engage in  research  into  market  development,  new  or  improved  methods  of  production,  packaging, and processing of wine, grapes, and  grape  products;  production  of  by-products  of  grape   manufacturing  processes  and  any other marketable products; improved methods of grape  breeding, virus resistance and control of pests  and  disease;  vineyard  conversion;  mechanization of brandy production; and overall improvement  in the production and quality of wines, grapes and grape products,    (b) Reduce agricultural unemployment  and  increase  state  and  local  revenues  by  developing methods and techniques to enhance the image and  quality of New York wine and grape products so  as  to  expand  existing  markets and develop new markets therefor,    (c) Advertise and promote the sale of wine and other grape products in  areas that will reach the greatest number of potential consumers,    (d)  Publish  and  distribute  to  producers,  retailers and consumers  information relating to the grape, wine and grape products industries,    (e) Facilitate educational and promotional activities to  enhance  the  image  of  New  York  wines  and  grape  products  through coordination,  promotional and educational activities with other organizations,    (f)  Carry  out  in  any  other way the declared policy of this act to  promote wine and other grape products and the  grape  industry  of  this  state.    2.

A  copy  of  such  petition  must be served upon the officer  accused and he shall have the right to appear and to give  evidence  and  to be heard in his defense.      5.

William  R.  Willcox,  Eugenius H. Outerbridge and Murray  Hulbert, or any two of them, commissioners  heretofore  appointed  under  chapter  four hundred and twenty-six of the laws of nineteen hundred and  seventeen of the state of New York, together with  the  attorney-general  of  the  state  of New York, are hereby authorized as commissioners upon  the part of the state of New York to enter into, with the state  of  New  Jersey,  by  and  through  the  commissioners  appointed  or  who may be  appointed under or by virtue of a law of the legislature of the state of  New Jersey, an agreement or compact in the form following,  that  is  to  say:    Whereas,  In  the  year eighteen hundred and thirty-four the states of  New York  and  New  Jersey  did  enter  into  an  agreement  fixing  and  determining  the  rights  and obligations of the two states in and about  the waters between the two states, especially in and about  the  bay  of  New York and the Hudson river; and    Whereas,  Since  that  time  the  commerce of the port of New York has  greatly developed and increased and the territory in and around the port  has become commercially one center or district; and    Whereas, It is confidently believed that a better co-ordination of the  terminal, transportation and other facilities of commerce in, about  and  through the port of New York, will result in great economies, benefiting  the nation, as well as the states of New York and New Jersey; and    Whereas,  The  future development of such terminal, transportation and  other facilities of commerce will require the expenditure of large  sums  of  money and the cordial co-operation of the states of New York and New  Jersey in the encouragement of the investment of  capital,  and  in  the  formulation and execution of the necessary physical plans; and    Whereas, Such result can best be accomplished through the co-operation  of the two states by and through a joint or common agency.    Now,  therefore,  The  said  states  of  New  Jersey  and  New York do  supplement and amend the existing  agreement  of  eighteen  hundred  and  thirty-four in the following respects:                                 ARTICLE I.    They  agree to and pledge, each to the other, faithful co-operation in  the future planning and development of the port of New York, holding  in  high  trust  for  the  benefit  of  the nation the special blessings and  natural advantages thereof.                                 ARTICLE II.

The port authority shall have such additional powers and duties as may  hereafter  be  delegated  to or imposed upon it from time to time by the  action  of  the  legislature  of  either  state  concurred  in  by   the  legislature  of the other. Unless and until otherwise provided, it shall  make an annual report to the legislature of both states,  setting  forth  in  detail  the  operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to  this agreement and any legislation thereunder. The port authority  shall  not  pledge  the credit of either state except by and with the authority  of the legislature thereof.                                * ARTICLE VII-A    The port  authority  shall  file  with  the  temporary  president  and  minority leader of the senate and the speaker and minority leader of the  assembly,  the chairman of the assembly ways and means committee and the  chairman of the senate finance committee of the state of  New  York  and  the  president,  minority  leader  and  secretary  of the senate and the  speaker, minority leader and clerk of the general assembly of the  state  of  New  Jersey  a copy of the minutes of any action taken at any public  meeting of the port authority.

ARTICLE IX.    Nothing contained in this agreement shall impair  the  powers  of  any  municipality to develop or improve port and terminal facilities.                                  ARTICLE X.

Where  such  state's  law permits service upon a  department of that state in lieu of  service  upon  the  public  entity,  service  may  be  made  pursuant  to  such  law. Except in an action for  wrongful death against such an entity, an  action  for  damages  or  for  injuries  to  real or personal property, or for the destruction thereof,  or for personal injuries, alleged to have been sustained, shall  not  be  commenced  more  than one year and ninety days after the cause of action  therefor  shall  have  accrued  or  within  the  time  period  otherwise  prescribed  by  any special provision of law of that state, whichever is  longer.    * NB Effective upon enactment of legislation of  identical  effect  by  the state of New Jersey or June 15, 2013, whichever is later                                ARTICLE XII.    The  port  authority may from time to time make recommendations to the  legislatures of the two states or to the congress of the United  States,  based  upon  study  and analysis, for the better conduct of the commerce  passing  in  and  through  the  port  of  New  York,  the  increase  and  improvement  of  transportation and terminal facilities therein, and the  more economical and expeditious handling of such commerce.                                 ARTICLE XIII    The port authority may petition any interstate commerce commission (or  like body), commissioner of transportation, public utilities  commission  (or  like  body),  or  any  other  federal,  municipal,  state  or local  authority, administrative, judicial or legislative, having  jurisdiction  in  the  premises,  after  the  adoption  of  the  comprehensive plan as  provided for in article ten, for  the  adoption  and  execution  of  any  physical  improvement,  change in method, rate of transportation, system  of handling freight, warehousing, docking,  lightering  or  transfer  of  freight, which, in the opinion of the port authority, may be designed to  improve or better the handling of commerce in and through said district,  or  improve  terminal  and  transportation  facilities  therein.  It may  intervene in any proceeding affecting the commerce of the port.                                 ARTICLE XIV.

ARTICLE XV.    Unless  and  until  the revenues from operations conducted by the port  authority are adequate to meet all expenditures, the legislatures of the  two states shall  appropriate,  in  equal  amounts,  annually,  for  the  salaries,  office and other administrative expenses, such sum or sums as  shall be recommended by the port authority and approved by the governors  of the two states, but each state obligates itself hereunder only to the  extent of one hundred thousand dollars in any one year.                                 ARTICLE XV-A    1. The legislature finds and declares that the right of the public  to  be present at meetings of the port authority of New York and New Jersey,  and  to  witness  in  full detail all phases of the deliberation, policy  formulation, and decision making of  the  authority,  is  vital  to  the  enhancement  and  proper functioning of the democratic process, and that  secrecy in  public  affairs  undermines  the  faith  of  the  public  in  government  and  the  public's effectiveness in fulfilling its role in a  democratic society; and declares it to be  the  public  policy  of  this  state  to  insure  the  right  of  its citizens to have adequate advance  notice of and the right to attend all meetings of the authority at which  any business affecting the public is discussed or acted upon in any  way  except  only  in those circumstances where otherwise the public interest  would be clearly endangered or the personal privacy of guaranteed rights  of individuals would be clearly in danger of unwarranted invasion.    2.

The board may incorporate in its rules and regulations  conditions under which it may exclude the public from  a  meeting  or  a  portion thereof.    Any  rules or regulations adopted hereunder shall become a part of the  minutes of the port authority of New York and New Jersey  and  shall  be  subject  to  the approval of the governor of New Jersey and the governor  of New York.                                * ARTICLE XV-B.     1.

Each  state  reserves the right to provide by law for the exercise of a veto power by  the  governor  thereof  over  any  action  of any commissioner appointed  therefrom.

ARTICLE XX.    The territorial or boundary lines  established  by  the  agreement  of  eighteen  hundred and thirty-four, or the jurisdiction of the two states  established thereby, shall not be changed except as herein  specifically  modified.                                 ARTICLE XXI.

In lieu of such an examination, the  state comptroller is hereby authorized to accept from such commission an  external examination of its books and accounts made at its request.     4. Such commission shall have power and authority over  the  survey,  development,   control   and  operation  of  port  facilities  and  such  facilities, operations or things as may  be  incidental  or  appurtenant  thereto,  within  such  port district, and the co-ordination of the same  with existing or future agencies of transportation, with a view  to  the  increase  and  efficiency  of all such facilities and the furtherance of  commerce and industries in the district; but nothing contained  in  this  section  shall be held to prevent any railroad corporation from building  and developing its own facilities and road upon its own property in  the  district  at  its  own  expense.  All  such  construction  by a railroad  corporation, however, shall conform to the general comprehensive plan of  the  commission,  for  port  development.  It  shall  make  a   thorough  investigation  of  port conditions in the district and such other places  as it may deem proper and shall prepare a  comprehensive  plan  for  the  development  of  port  facilities in such district. It shall be provided  with an office which shall be located by such commission within the port  district and it shall  have  power  to  equip  the  same  with  suitable  furniture   and  supplies  for  the  performance  of  the  work  of  the  commission. It shall (1) make an annual report of  its  proceedings  and  deliver  a copy of the same to the state superintendent of public works,  the state engineer and surveyor, the mayor, and the  common  council  of  each  municipality  within the port district, the resident United States  army engineer, the chief of engineers of the United States army and  the  secretary of commerce of the United States;    (2)  submit  to  the  governor,  the  chairman  of  the senate finance  committee, the chairman of the assembly ways and means committee and the  state comptroller, within ninety days after the end of its fiscal year a  complete  and  detailed  report  setting  forth:  (1)  its   operations,  accomplishments and plans; (2) its receipts and expenditures during such  fiscal  year and its estimated receipts and expenditures for the current  fiscal  year  in  accordance  with  the  categories  or  classifications  established  by  the commission for its own operating and capital outlay  purposes; (3) its assets and liabilities at the end of its  fiscal  year  including  the  status of reserve, depreciation, special or other funds;  and (4) a schedule of its bonds and notes outstanding at the end of  its  fiscal  year,  together  with  a  statement  of the amounts redeemed and  incurred during such fiscal year;    (3) submit to  the  governor,  the  chairman  of  the  senate  finance  committee, the chairman of the assembly ways and means committee and the  state  comptroller  within  thirty  days  after  receipt  thereof by the  commission, a copy of the report of every external  examination  of  its  books and accounts other than copies of the reports of such examinations  made by the state comptroller.     5. Such port commission also shall (1) Have power to confer with the  governing  bodies of each of the municipalities within the port district  and dock, port, harbor, channel and improvement commission and any other  body or official having to do with port and harbor facilities within and  without the district and hold public hearings as to such facilities;    (2) Have power to confer with the railroad, steamship,  warehouse  and  other  officials  in  the  district with reference to the development of  transportation facilities in such district and the co-ordination of  the  same;    (3)  Confer  with  the proper state officials as to means and measures  for stimulating the use of the barge canal;    (4) Formulate and adopt a financial, building and  operation  program,  which shall be submitted to the mayor of each city, in the district, who  shall  be entitled to be heard thereon before formal adoption, notice of  such hearing to be given in writing at least twenty days before the  day  of such hearing;    (5)  Have power to adopt a comprehensive plan, and to change or revise  the same, for the development of port facilities in such district, which  plan may provide separately for the work  of  initial  development,  and  shall  include  an  estimate of the total cost of all the work and/or of  the work included in such initial development, and to apportion the cost  thereof, as provided in section eight, and  not  oftener  than  once  in  three  years  to  revise  such  apportionment to accord with any changes  theretofore made in the comprehensive plan, as required by said  section  eight;  and  as part of such comprehensive plan, or pursuant thereto, to  determine upon the location, type, size and  construction  of  requisite  port  facilities,  subject, however, to the approval of the secretary of  war and chief of engineers, United States Army, where federal statute or  regulation requires it;    (6) Have power to acquire, lease, erect, construct,  make,  equip  and  maintain  port facilities within or outside the district, either on land  owned by the district or upon land set aside for its uses  and  control,  as provided in section thirteen, and for any such purpose to acquire and  improve  real  property,  including easements therein, lands under water  and riparian rights, by agreement or by condemnation, and to sell, rent,  exchange or dispose of any property,  real  or  personal,  as  may  seem  advisable;    (7)  Have  power to contract with any municipality in the district for  the construction by the municipality of  one  or  more  docks,  wharves,  terminals or warehouses, to belong to the municipality and be maintained  by  it, whereby a part of the cost of construction shall be borne by the  district, in  cases  where  the  commission,  after  a  public  hearing,  determines  that  such  work is of common benefit to the municipalities,  inhabitants and property in the district;    (8)  Have  power  to  execute  contracts  within  the  provisions  and  limitations of this act;    (9)  Have  power to fix rates, charges and wharfage for the use of all  port facilities, or to rent the  same  or  grant  the  use  thereof  for  limited periods, and collect rates, rents, charges and wharfage for such  facilities owned or controlled by the district;    (10)  Operate  and maintain all port facilities owned or controlled by  it, including a general terminal railroad connecting with  any  railroad  within  said district, use the revenues therefrom for the upkeep thereof  and the expenses of the commission and the residue, if any, on  hand  at  the   end  of  any  fiscal  year,  for  further  construction  and  port  development, or in reduction of taxation;    (11)  Have  power  to  regulate  and  supervise  the  construction and  operation of all port facilities, by whomsoever  constructed,  installed  or owned;    (12) Expend moneys, if any, appropriated by the state for the purposes  of  this  act on account of benefits accruing thereunder to the state or  its property;    (13) Have power to create and maintain a traffic bureau;    (14) Have power to employ such clerical, engineering, legal  or  other  professional  assistants  as  it  may deem necessary for the purposes of  this act, fix their compensation and at pleasure discharge any of them;    (15) Have power to do all things necessary to make the  deeper  Hudson  project useful and productive.    The  terms ""facilities,"" ""port facilities,"" ""terminals,"" and ""terminal  work"" as used in this act, shall include, among other  things,  wharves,  docks,  piers, terminals, railroad tracks on terminals, cold storage and  refrigerating  plants,  warehouses,  elevators,  and  such   facilities,  operations  or  things  as may be incidental or appurtenant thereto, and  such property real or personal as may be acquired or used in  connection  therewith,   personal  service,  freight  handling  machinery  and  such  equipment as is used in the handling of freight  and  the  establishment  and  operation  of  a  port,  and the appurtenances thereto, and work of  deepening parts of the Hudson river adjacent to the terminal,  exclusive  of the channel, within the port district.      6.  The  commission  may  make,  and  cause  to  be served upon any  municipal or other corporation, or individual, within the district,  any  reasonable  order  which it may determine to be necessary for the proper  development,  maintenance  and  use  of  the  port,  relating   to   the  construction,  equipment,  repair,  maintenance,  use  and rental of any  dock, wharf, slip,  terminal  or  warehouse  owned  or  leased  by  such  corporation  or individual within the district. With a copy of the order  shall be served a notice specifying a day, not less than ten days  after  such  service,  when  such corporation may appear before the commission,  present written objections to the making of the order and  be  heard  on  such  objections. If no such objections be filed within the time stated,  or if the order be sustained as the result of such  hearing,  either  in  its original or a modified form, such order shall be final, subject only  to  review by a court of competent jurisdiction; but no order staying or  suspending an order of  the  commission  shall  be  made  by  any  court  otherwise  than upon notice and after a hearing; and if the order of the  commission is suspended, the order suspending the same shall  contain  a  specific  finding  based  upon  evidence  submitted  to  the  court  and  identified by reference thereto that great and irreparable damage  would  otherwise  result  to  the  petitioner  and specifying the nature of the  damage. When an order of the commission shall  become  final,  including  the  termination of any court proceeding sustaining the order, or of the  time for beginning  such  a  proceeding  if  none  be  brought,  if  the  corporation  or individual shall fail to obey it, or if any municipal or  other corporation or individual shall  violate  a  lawful  rule  of  the  commission,  the  commission  may  commence  and  maintain  an action or  proceeding in the name of the Albany port district,  in  an  appropriate  court  having  jurisdiction, for the purpose of having such disobedience  to an order or violation of a  rule  prevented  or  obedience  enforced,  either  by  mandamus or injunction.  Such an action or proceeding may be  brought in the supreme court, which shall  have  jurisdiction  to  grant  mandamus or injunction or any other relief appropriate to the case.      7.  The  commission,  and  any  member thereof when directed by the  commission, may make any investigation which  the  commission  may  deem  necessary  to  enable it effectually to carry out the provisions of this  act, and for that purpose the commission, or such member, may  take  and  hear proofs and testimony and compel the attendance of witnesses and the  production  of  books,  papers,  records and documents, including public  records. The commission and its authorized agents  may  enter  upon  any  lands  as  in  its  judgment  may be necessary for the purpose of making  surveys and examinations to accomplish any purpose  authorized  by  this  act, the district being liable for actual damage done.      8. In the preparation of its comprehensive plan of port development  provided for in this act,  the  commission  shall  incorporate  existing  facilities  as  an  integral part thereof, so far as practicable. If the  commission shall determine as part of such plan that the district  shall  construct  any  port  facilities  or  contribute  to  the  cost  of such  facilities to be constructed by any municipality, the plan shall contain  specifications of all such work, estimates of the cost of  each  and  an  estimate  of  the  total cost, including the cost of acquiring necessary  real property; and the total cost of  such  work,  and  amount  of  such  contributions  shall be borne by all the municipalities in the district,  except as  hereinafter  provided.  The  commission  also  shall  make  a  tentative   determination   and  shall  annex  to  and  file  with  such  specifications and estimates  a  statement  showing  the  proportion  of  benefit  to  each  municipality  in the district from such improvements,  regard being had to the special benefit to the municipality in which any  district part of such work is to be done, and from the estimated  annual  average  expenditures  of  the  commission,  other than for construction  work, for a period of three years. Such proportions shall  be  expressed  in  decimals. The development of such port shall be deemed and is hereby  declared to be  a  public,  municipal  purpose  of  each  city,  in  the  district,  to  the  extent  of the local benefits accruing and to accrue  therefrom.   Such decimal,  with  respect  to  any  municipality,  shall  represent  the proportion of the total cost to be borne by it, and shall  be the proportion of the total amount to be raised annually  by  tax  on  the  taxable property in the municipality of the portion of such cost to  be provided annually, of the annual expenses  of  the  commission  other  than  for construction work and contributions to municipal construction,  and of any installment of principal and interest of  any  obligation  of  the  district  next to become due. At the end of each three year period,  new estimates shall be made of the expenses  of  the  commission,  other  than for construction work and such contributions, for the ensuing three  years,  and,  if  necessary, such apportionment shall be revised. It may  also  be  revised  if  there  be  subsequent  construction   work,   not  contemplated  by  the original comprehensive plan, by which the relative  benefits of the whole work to the several  municipalities  are  altered.  Notwithstanding, however, any provisions of this act, the entire cost of  construction  of  any  port facilities within the city of Albany or upon  land owned by said city, including the cost of acquiring  the  necessary  real property therefor, shall be borne by the city of Albany. Before any  apportionment  under  this section, or revision thereof, shall be deemed  final,  the  commission  shall  cause  its  determination  as  to   such  apportionment  to  be  published in at least two daily newspapers in the  district, twice in each week for two weeks,  and  shall  therewith  give  notice  of  a  public hearing on such apportionment, to be held not less  than ten days after the last publication. It shall also give  notice  to  each  municipality  by mailing a notice setting forth the time and place  of such hearing, which said notice shall be mailed to the mayor, and the  corporation counsel of each municipality at least ten  days  before  the  day   of   such   hearing.   It  shall  give  such  a  hearing  and  the  representatives of the governing body of a municipality and any taxpayer  in the district may be heard for or in opposition to such apportionment.  After  such hearing the commission shall file in the office of the clerk  of each such municipality its final determination, either affirming such  original apportionment or modifying it and affirming it as modified.     9. The fiscal year of the district shall be from July first to  June  thirtieth,  inclusive.  Annually,  in  the month of June, the commission  shall file with the clerk and with the treasurer of  each  city  in  the  district,  a  statement  of  the  amount to be raised upon the territory  within  such  city  and  paid  to  the  commission,  for  the  estimated  expenditures  of  the commission under this act during such fiscal year,  including construction cost, expenses other than for  construction,  and  installments  of the district debt, if any, and interest, to fall due in  such year. The statement shall specify when the amount shall be paid  to  the  commission  which  shall,  so  far  as  practicable,  be  after the  collection of taxes next to be levied in or for such  municipality.  The  clerk  of  each  city  shall cause such statement to be presented to the  legislative governing body, and board of estimate, if any, of the  city,  at  its  next  meeting,  and  such  board or body shall cause the amount  chargeable to the several parcels of real  estate  in  the  city  to  be  levied  upon  such real estate in the city by the first annual municipal  tax levy next occurring, in proportion to the valuation of  the  taxable  real property for city taxes. The amounts chargeable under this section,  when  collected,  shall  be  paid to the treasurer of the commission. In  determining the total amount to be raised for any fiscal year under this  section  the  commission  shall  deduct  from  its  estimate  of   total  expenditures  the probable amount of net revenues, if any, from its port  facilities, and the amount of any appropriations by the  legislature  to  be available in such year.    Prior  to  the first apportionment of construction cost to the several  municipalities,  under  this  act,  and  the  fixing  of   the   decimal  representing  the proportion of benefit, the expenses of the commission,  or so much thereof as may not be provided for by  state  appropriations,  annually shall be borne by the several cities in the proportion that the  assessed  valuation  of  the  taxable  property in the district; and the  necessary statement shall be filed with each city clerk, as provided  in  this  section,  and the provisions of this section, relative to levy and  collection of a tax to pay such amounts shall apply thereto.     10. After estimates of the cost of any improvement  or  improvements  by  the  commission  under  this  act shall have been made and after the  apportionment, or any  revision  or  apportionment,  covering  any  such  improvement or improvements shall have become final, as provided in this  act,  whereby  the  proportions  to  be  paid  by the real estate in the  several municipalities shall have been determined,  the  commission  may  provide  moneys  for construction of such improvements, in an amount not  exceeding such  estimated  cost.  Any  judicial  review  of  such  final  apportionment by the commission, however, shall not delay or prevent the  commencement  of construction work. Bonds or notes of the district shall  not be construed in any event as obligations of the state, and the state  shall not be obligated to pay the principal or interest, or either.     10-A. Subject to the provisions of section three of article eight of  the constitution  and  section  six-a  of  the  general  municipal  law,  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of any other general, special or local  laws: (a) With the approval of and on terms and conditions prescribed by  the state comptroller, the commission may refund the  principal  of  and  issue  bonds  of  the  district  to  pay  the  interest  on  any  bonded  indebtedness or portion thereof  contracted  before  the  first  day  of  January,   nineteen  hundred  thirty-nine.  The  consent  of  the  state  comptroller  shall be executed under his hand and seal in duplicate. One  of such duplicates shall be filed in the office  of  the  department  of  audit  and  control  and  the  other  in  the office of the chief fiscal  officer of the commission. Both  of  such  duplicates  shall  be  public  records.  All  such  bonds  shall contain a recital that they are issued  pursuant to this section, which recital shall be conclusive evidence  of  their  validity  and of the regularity of the issue. The validity of the  bonds hereby authorized shall in no wise be affected by  the  invalidity  of,  or  any irregularity in any proceeding authorizing the issuance of,  the obligations the principal of or interest on which is to be paid with  the proceeds thereof except that bonds shall not be issued  to  pay  the  principal  of  or  interest on bonds of the district adjudged invalid by  the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. No bonds issued  pursuant to this section shall be refunded. Such bonds may be authorized  at any general or special meeting of the commission by  the  vote  of  a  majority  of  the commission. Such bonds shall show upon their face that  the  payment  thereof  is  secured  by  general  tax  in   the   several  municipalities  in the Albany Port District under the provisions of this  act, reciting the title and chapter number hereof, and that the proceeds  of such tax are hereby pledged for the payment of such bonds. Such bonds  shall not be construed in any event as  bonds  or  indebtedness  of  the  state,  and  the  state  shall  not be obligated to pay the principal or  interest, or either, nor shall such bonds be considered  obligations  of  cities and subject to the provisions of section four of article eight of  the  constitution  of  the  state  of  New  York.  Such bonds shall bear  interest at a rate of not exceeding six per centum  per  annum,  payable  semi-annually. Such bonds, as issued from time to time, shall be paid in  annual  installments,  the first of which shall be payable not more than  five years and the last of which shall be payable  not  later  than  the  year  nineteen hundred and sixty-one. None of such installments shall be  more than twice the amount of any prior installment. Such bonds shall be  exempt from taxation except for transfer  and  inheritance  taxes.  They  shall  be  signed  by  the  chairman  of the commission, attested by its  secretary and have the seal of the district affixed thereto. The coupons  shall bear the facsimile signature of the treasurer of  the  commission.  They  shall be sold at not less than par. The commission shall sell such  bonds to the highest bidder after advertisement for  a  period  of  five  consecutive  days,  Sundays and holidays excepted, in at least two daily  newspapers published in the city of Albany. Advertisements shall contain  a provision to the effect that the commission, in  its  discretion,  may  reject  any  or  all bids made in pursuance of such advertisement and in  the event of such rejection, the commission is authorized to readvertise  for bids in the form and manner above described as many times as in  its  judgment  may  be  necessary  to effect a sale. In the event that at any  time prior to April first, nineteen  hundred  forty-three  no  bids  are  received  on  the  date named in such advertisement, the commission may,  within sixty days thereafter at a regular or special  meeting  at  which  not  less  than  four  members are present and acting by the affirmative  vote of not less than three members, sell such bonds or any part thereof  at private sale, with or without competition on any bid which  it  could  have  legally  accepted  had  it been received on the date named in such  advertisement. Such bonds shall be lawful investments for  trustees  and  savings  banks  of the state, and may be accepted as investments for any  of the sinking funds or other funds or moneys of the state or of any  of  the agencies, municipalities or political subdivisions of the state.    (b)  The  amount of any bonds issued hereunder for any purpose, except  to  pay  the  principal  on  maturing  bonds,  shall  be   included   in  ascertaining  the  power  of  each  of the cities within the district to  contract indebtedness; the portion  of  the  total  to  be  included  in  computing  the  debt  of  each  city to be determined in accordance with  general law.    (c) Any provisions of this chapter inconsistent with the provisions of  this section ten-A shall not apply to the bonds hereby authorized to  be  issued.      10-b.  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this act or of  any other general, special or  local  law,  all  bonds  issued  by  such  commission  after  this section shall become effective, shall be sold at  public sale, except that such commission may sell any of  its  bonds  at  private sale if the state comptroller upon proper application shall give  his  approval  and consent in writing to such private sale and the terms  thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, such commission may not  sell any of its bonds to  the  state  comptroller  at  private  sale  or  exchange  any  of  its  bonds  for any of its bonds or notes held by the  state comptroller.     11. No proposition of expenditure of money for  the  acquisition  of  any  real  property, or interest therein or the purchase of machinery or  equipment, or the  work  of  construction  of  terminals,  involving  an  expenditure of one thousand dollars or upwards, shall be adopted without  the  consent  of three members of such commission. All construction work  and the purchase of machinery which would involve an expenditure of more  than  one  thousand  dollars  shall  be   upon   contract,   let   after  advertisement  and  competitive bidding, and on plans and specifications  on file in the office of the commission.     12. No member of such commission shall  be  pecuniarily  interested,  either directly or indirectly, in the doing or furnishing of any work or  material  for  the  commission or any municipality, in carrying out such  plan of port development.     13. Any municipality within the district may set  aside  and  devote  any  property  owned by such municipality and which is suitable for port  facilities, to the uses and control of the  port  commission,  provided,  that the legislative body of such municipality shall, by a majority vote  of  all  its  members  and,  where  there  is  a  board  of estimate and  apportionment, by a vote also of a majority of all the members  of  such  board,  give consent to such use and control and prescribe the terms and  conditions upon which the same shall be held.     14. The title to any real estate, or interest therein  acquired  for  port  facilities  and  to  any  improvements  which may be made thereon,  situate in any municipality which has paid for the same, shall remain in  such municipality; but such property shall be  maintained  and  operated  subject  to  the rules and the control of the port commission, and shall  be used for port purposes.     15. The sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000), or so much thereof as  may be necessary, is hereby appropriated from any moneys  in  the  state  treasury   not  otherwise  appropriated,  for  paying  the  expenses  in  connection with the appointment and functioning of  the  commission,  as  provided  in  this  act,  until  the  moneys  necessary  for meeting the  expenses thereafter incurred by such commission, may be assessed, levied  and  collected  in  the  municipalities  within  the  port  district  as  hereinbefore  provided;  and  such  sum,  or  so  much thereof as may be  necessary, shall be paid by the state treasurer on the  warrant  of  the  comptroller upon the order of the chairman of the port commission."

Local agencies or other issuers  may  at  any  time  apply  to  the  commissioner  for  an  allocation  from the statewide bond reserve. Such  application shall demonstrate:    (i) that the requested allocation is required under the code  for  the  interest  earned  on  the  bonds to be excluded from the gross income of  bondholders for federal income tax purposes;    (ii) that the local  agency's  remaining  unused  allocation  provided  pursuant  to  section  three  of  this act, and other issuer's remaining  unused allocation, or any available carryforward  will  be  insufficient  for the specific project or projects for which the reserve allocation is  requested; and    (iii)  that,  except  for  those  allocations made pursuant to section  eleven of this act  to  enable  carryforward  elections,  the  requested  allocation is reasonably expected to be used during the calendar year.    b.  In  reviewing  and  approving  or  disapproving  applications, the  commissioner  shall  exercise  discretion   to   ensure   an   equitable  distribution  of  allocations  from  the statewide bond reserve to local  agencies and other issuers. Prior to  making  a  determination  on  such  applications,  the commissioner shall notify and seek the recommendation  of the commissioner of housing and community renewal in the case  of  an  application  related to the issuance of multi-family housing or mortgage  revenue bonds, and in the case of other requests, such  state  officers,  departments,   divisions   and   agencies   as  the  commissioner  deems  appropriate.    c. Applications for allocations shall be made in such form and contain  such information and reports as the commissioner shall require.    3.  Allocation  of  statewide  bond  reserve  to state agencies.   The  director may make an allocation from the statewide bond reserve  to  any  state  agency. Before making any allocation of statewide bond reserve to  state agencies the director shall be satisfied:    a. that the allocation is required under the  code  for  the  interest  earned  on the bonds to be excluded from the gross income of bondholders  for federal income tax purposes;    b. that  the  state  agency's  remaining  unused  allocation  provided  pursuant  to section four of this act or any available carryforward will  be insufficient to accommodate the specific bond  issue  or  issues  for  which the reserve allocation is requested; and    c.  that, except for those allocations made pursuant to section eleven  of this act to enable carryforward elections, the  requested  allocation  is reasonably expected to be used during the calendar year.   * NB Repealed January 1, 1991    *    6.  Access  to  employment  opportunities.  1. All issuers shall  require that any new employment opportunities created in connection with  industrial or manufacturing projects financed through  the  issuance  of  qualified  small  issue  bonds  shall  be listed with the New York state  department of labor job service division, and  with  the  administrative  entity of the service delivery area created pursuant to the Job Training  Partnership  Act  (Pub.

L. 97-300) programs who shall be referred  to  the  industrial  or  manufacturing  firm by administrative entities of service delivery areas  created pursuant to such act or by  the  job  service  division  at  the  department of labor. Issuers of qualified small issue bonds are required  to  monitor compliance with the provisions of this section as prescribed  by the commissioner.    2. Nothing in this section shall be  construed  to  require  users  of  qualified   small   issue  bonds  to  violate  any  existing  collective  bargaining agreement with  respect  to  the  hiring  of  new  employees.  Failure on the part of any user of qualified small issue bonds to comply  with the requirements of this section shall not affect the allocation of  bonding  authority  to  the  issuer  of the bonds or the validity or tax  exempt status of such bonds.   * NB Repealed January 1, 1991    *  7.

Where  there  is  a local agency for the benefit of a village  within the geographic area of a town for the benefit of which there is a  local agency, the allocation of the village local agency shall be  based  on  the  population  of  the  geographic  area  of  the village, and the  allocation of the town local agency shall be based upon  the  population  of   the   geographic   area   of  the  town  outside  of  the  village.

The political subdivision may then reallocate  all or any portion of such allocation, as well as all or any portion  of  the allocation received pursuant to section eight of this act, to itself  or  any  other  issuer  established  for  the  benefit of that political  subdivision or may assign all or any portion of the allocation  received  pursuant  to  section  eight of this act to the local agency created for  its benefit.

If  the  commissioner  determines  that  a  local  agency  or  other  issuer  has  overestimated the amount of covered bonds  subject  to  allocation  that  will  be  issued prior to the end of the calendar year, the commissioner  may recapture the amount of the allocation to such local agency or other  issuer represented by such overestimation by notice to the local  agency  or  other issuer, and add such allocation to the statewide bond reserve.

Section  1.  Short  title. This act shall be known and may be cited as  the ""Urban development guarantee fund of New York act"".     2. Statement of legislative findings and purposes.  The  legislature  hereby  finds  that  in  certain  urban areas of our state the growth of  small business is impeded by the unavailability of reasonable credit for  buildings, equipment, credit for inventory and working  capital.    This  unavailability  of  reasonable  credit restricts business growth and job  opportunities and causes business failures resulting in unemployment and  underemployment with resulting persistent poverty in such  urban  areas.  The  amelioration  of  these  conditions is a responsibility of both the  public and private sector of our economy. Rehabilitation of the economic  life of blighted  areas  is  necessary  in  order  to  prevent  business  failures, to maintain the income of existing small business enterprises,  to  provide  a  business  climate  conducive  to the growth of new small  business enterprises, and to broaden the tax base of such  urban  areas,  all   to   afford   more  meaningful  and  rewarding  business  and  job  opportunities for the residents of  such  areas,  thereby  reducing  the  hazards  of  unemployment  and  raising  the  job  opportunities  of the  underemployed.    The legislature further finds that in certain urban areas of our state  the construction,  reconstruction,  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  housing  accommodations  is impeded by the shortage of mortgage funds at  reasonable interest rates and the  lack  of  available  credit  for  the  rehabilitation  of older buildings which lack proper heating or sanitary  facilities or which do not comply  in  full  with  modern  building  and  maintenance  code  standards.  The unaided efforts of private enterprise  have not provided and cannot provide an  adequate  supply  of  safe  and  sanitary  housing  within  the financial reach of many families in urban  areas. The upgrading and improvement of such areas through  programs  of  new  construction,  rehabilitation  and  home  improvement  can  provide  additional tax revenues to the community and assist  in  attracting  and  retaining business and industry.    In  order  to  assist  in  the  rehabilitation of these areas and give  constructive attention to the welfare of the needy  residents  of  these  areas, the legislature finds and declares that the marshalling of public  and  private  capital  to make sufficient credit available at the lowest  feasible interest rates to encourage the expansion of small business, to  provide the incentives for the establishment of sound new small business  enterprises and  to  promote  the  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  housing accommodations in such areas, will create new job opportunities,  effectively  reduce unemployment and strengthen the economic base of the  community as a whole, thereby reducing the burdens of poverty and need.    This result can best be accomplished by a loan  guarantee  program  to  guarantee   loans   to   small   businesses   and   owners   of  housing  accommodations,  including  one  and  two  family  homes  and   multiple  dwellings,  unable  to  obtain  reasonable  credit  through conventional  financial sources. The legislature further finds that  the  adoption  of  such  a loan guarantee program to mitigate the economic and social evils  of unemployment, underemployment and inadequate housing is for a  public  purpose,  and to achieve these ends there should be created a non-profit  corporation to be known as the urban development guarantee fund  of  New  York, having such powers and duties as set forth herein.     3. Definitions. 1. ""Small business"" shall mean a business located in  an  area  having one or more of the characteristics described in section  two  which  is  unable  to  obtain  adequate  financing  to  maintain  a  stabilized work force or increase job opportunities by virtue of (a) its  location, (b) its net assets or (c) its dollar volume of business.    2.  ""Fund"" shall mean the urban development guarantee fund of New York  created by section four of this act.    3. ""Small  business  project""  shall  mean  construction  of  any  new  building,  purchase  of  an  existing  building,  or  refinancing  of an  existing  building  in  order  to  facilitate  substantial   improvement  thereto, the financing of real property deemed essential for the conduct  of  business,  the  extension  or  provision  of utilities and any other  appurtenant facilities  to  be  used  by  any  small  business,  or  any  necessary  machinery,  equipment  or  stock,  working  capital  or other  capital investment therein, or any combination of the  foregoing,  which  the fund shall determine will tend to provide gainful employment for the  people  of  the  state  and/or  increase the tax base of the economy, or  diversify  and  expand  small  business,  or  any  combination  of   the  foregoing.    4.  ""Housing project"" shall mean the construction of any new building,  purchase of an existing building or refinancing of an existing  building  and  real  property  deemed  essential  to  such  project,  in  order to  facilitate substantial improvement thereto,  designed  and  intended  to  provide  housing  accommodations  for  persons and families which cannot  afford safe and sanitary housing accommodations provided by the  unaided  efforts  of private enterprise, and such facilities as may be incidental  and appurtenant thereto.    5. ""Loan guarantee fund"" shall mean the fund created in section six of  this act.    6. ""Operation and maintenance fund"" shall mean  the  fund  created  in  section seven of this act.    7. ""Lending institution"" shall mean the original lender under the loan  agreement  of  participants  therein and its successors and assigns, and  may include but is not limited to, an  individual  lender,  corporation,  insurance  company, bank, investment company, executor, trustee or other  fiduciary, pension, profit sharing, and retirement fund.    8. ""Payments"" shall mean periodic payments called for under the  terms  of   a  loan,  and  may  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  interest,  installments  of  principal,  taxes  and  assessments,  loan   insurance  premiums and hazard insurance premiums.    9.  ""New  York  state  urban  development  corporation"" shall mean the  corporation created by the New York state urban development  corporation  act.      4. Urban development guarantee fund of New York. 1. There is hereby  created a non-profit corporation which shall  be  known  as  the  ""Urban  Development Guarantee Fund of New York."" Except as otherwise provided in  this  act, the fund shall have all the powers, privileges and immunities  which are now or may hereafter be conferred on business corporations  by  the business corporation law.    2.  The  business  of  the  fund  shall be managed by, and its powers,  functions and duties shall be exercised through a  board  of  directors,  consisting  of  the  directors  of  the New York state urban development  corporation.    3. The chairman of the fund shall be the  chairman  of  the  New  York  state  urban development corporation. Each director shall be entitled to  reimbursement for his actual and  necessary  expenses  incurred  in  the  performance of his official duties with the fund.    4.  Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent  provisions  of  law,  general,  special or local, no officer or employee of the state or  of  any  civil  division thereof, shall be deemed to have forfeited or shall forfeit his  office  or  employment  by reason of his acceptance of membership on the  fund created by this section; provided, however, a  director  who  holds  such  other  public  office  or  employment  shall receive no additional  compensation or allowance for services rendered pursuant  to  this  act,  but  shall  be  entitled  to  reimbursement for his actual and necessary  expenses incurred in the performance of such services.    5.  The  fund  and  its  corporate  existence  shall  continue   until  terminated  by  law,  which law shall provide for the disposition of the  properties and assets of the fund and the assumption of its liabilities,  if any. In no  event  shall  such  law  take  effect  while  debentures,  guarantees  or  other  obligations  of  the fund are outstanding, unless  adequate provision is made in such law for the liquidation, satisfaction  or securing of such obligations.    6. The powers of the fund shall be exercised by affirmative vote of no  less than five of the directors thereof then in  office.  The  fund  may  delegate  to  one  or more of its directors, or its officers, agents and  employees, such powers and duties as it may deem proper.    7. The fund may appoint one or more advisory committees consisting  of  not  more  than  seven members each to consider and advise the fund upon  all matters submitted to them by the fund and to recommend to  the  fund  such changes in the administration of this act and the operations of the  fund  as the advisory committee may deem desirable.  Members of advisory  committees shall serve without salary for such terms, not to exceed four  years, as the fund may determine. Each member of an  advisory  committee  shall be entitled to reimbursement for his actual and necessary expenses  incurred in the performance of his duties.      5.  Powers and limitations. 1.

Creation of a state debt.          3. Bonds of the state.          4. Consistency with federal tax law.     Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as  the ""jobs for the new, New York bond act.""      2.  Creation  of  a  state debt. The creation of a state debt to an  amount not exceeding in the  aggregate  eight  hundred  million  dollars  ($800,000,000)  is  hereby  authorized  to provide moneys for the single  purpose of funding infrastructure projects to promote  the  creation  or  retention of permanent private sector jobs.    A  well-developed  and  maintained  infrastructure is necessary to the  creation, preservation  and  enhancement  of  an  environment  to  which  businesses  can  be  attracted,  and  in  which they can be retained and  nurtured, thereby creating or retaining private  sector  employment  and  reducing  the  state's  unemployment,  both of which are critical to the  economic and social well-being of the state.    The legislature may, by appropriate legislation and  subject  to  such  conditions  as  it may impose, make available out of the proceeds of the  sale of bonds authorized in this act, moneys for state programs  or  for  payments  of  the  state  share of the cost of programs undertaken by or  through a state agency or state or  local  public  benefit  corporation,  industrial  development  agency,  county,  city,  town,  village, Indian  nation or government or any combination  thereof,  for  the  purpose  of  funding  infrastructure  projects undertaken by or through such entities  and to match federal or other funds which may from time to time be  made  available  by  congress  or from other sources to such entities for such  purpose.     3. Bonds of the state. The state comptroller  is  hereby  authorized  and  empowered  to  issue  and  sell bonds of the state to the amount of  eight hundred million dollars ($800,000,000) for  the  purpose  of  this  act,  subject  to  the provisions of article 5 of the state finance law.  The aggregate principal amount of such  bonds  shall  not  exceed  eight  hundred  million dollars ($800,000,000) excluding bonds issued to refund  or otherwise repay bonds theretofore issued for such purpose;  provided,  however,  that  upon any such refunding or repayment the total aggregate  principal amount of outstanding bonds may be greater than eight  hundred  million  dollars  ($800,000,000)  only  if  the  present  value  of  the  aggregate debt service of the refunding or repayment bonds to be  issued  shall  not exceed the present value of the aggregate debt service of the  bonds to be refunded or repaid.     4. Consistency with federal tax law. Bonds issued pursuant  to  this  act  may  be  issued  as taxable or tax-exempt bonds for purposes of the  federal internal revenue code and regulations  thereunder.  All  actions  taken  pursuant  to  this  act  shall  be  reviewed for consistency with  provisions  of  the  federal  internal  revenue  code  and   regulations  thereunder, in accordance with procedures established in connection with  the  issuance of any bonds pursuant to this act which are intended to be  federally tax exempt to preserve the federal tax exempt status  of  such  bonds.  Any  bonds  issued pursuant to this act together with the income  therefrom shall be exempt from  state  and  local  taxation  except  for  transfer  and  estate taxes. The state covenants with the purchasers and  with all subsequent holders and transferees of bonds issued pursuant  to  this  act,  in  consideration  of  the acceptance of and payment for the  bonds, that the bonds  issued  pursuant  to  this  act  and  the  income  therefrom shall be free from such taxation, as aforestated herein.      2.  This  act  shall not take effect unless and until it shall have  been submitted to the people at the  general  election  to  be  held  in  November  1992, and shall have received a majority of all votes cast for  and against it at such election. Upon approval by the  people  this  act  shall  take  effect immediately. The ballots to be furnished for the use  of the voters upon the submission of this  act  shall  be  in  the  form  prescribed  by  the  election law, and the proposition or question to be  submitted shall be printed thereon in substantially the following  form,  namely,  ""Shall  chapter  (here insert the number of the chapter) of the  laws of 1992 known as the jobs for the new, New  York  bond  act,  which  promotes  the creation or retention of permanent private sector jobs, by  authorizing  the  creation  of  state  debt  to   provide   moneys   for  infrastructure  projects  in the amount of eight hundred million dollars  ($800,000,000), be approved?""    * NB Effective upon approval at general election in November, 1992"

VAT225,"Vehicle and Traffic      225. Jurisdiction; transfer of cases; hearing officers; regulations.  1.  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of law, all violations of  this chapter or of a law, ordinance, order, rule or regulation  relating  to  traffic,  except parking, standing, stopping or pedestrian offenses,  which occur within a city having a population of two hundred thousand or  more in which administrative tribunals have heretofore been established,  and which are classified  as  traffic  infractions,  may  be  heard  and  determined  pursuant  to the regulations of the commissioner as provided  in this article. Whenever a crime and a traffic infraction arise out  of  the  same transaction or occurrence, a charge alleging both offenses may  be made returnable before the court having jurisdiction over the  crime.  Nothing  herein  provided  shall be construed to prevent a court, having  jurisdiction over a criminal charge relating to  traffic  or  a  traffic  infraction,  from lawfully entering a judgment of conviction, whether or  not based on a plea of guilty, for any offense classified as  a  traffic  infraction.    2.  Whenever  the  commissioner or his deputy determines that a charge  alleges an offense other than a traffic infraction, he shall, and  where  a  charge  cannot  be  disposed  of because of the non-appearance of the  motorist, he may  notify  the  court  of  appropriate  jurisdiction  and  request  removal of the case to such court. Prior notice of such request  need not be given the motorist involved. Upon receipt of  such  request,  the  court  may grant an order transferring such case, provided that the  date on which the charge or charges must be answered  before  the  court  shall not be earlier than the return date which appears on the complaint  alleging  the  offense. Notice of transfer of cases involving other than  traffic infractions shall be mailed  to  the  motorist  at  the  address  appearing  on  such  complaint not less than ten days before the date of  appearance indicated on his summons  and  not  less  than  fifteen  days  before  his  scheduled  appearance  in such court. Notice of transfer of  cases which cannot be disposed of because of the non-appearance  of  the  motorist  shall  be  mailed  to the motorist at the address appearing on  such  complaint  not  less  than  fifteen  days  before  his   scheduled  appearance  in  such  court. Such mailing shall constitute due notice of  such transfer. Thereafter, such case shall be treated in the same manner  as if the complaint had initially been filed with such court.    3. The commissioner shall appoint such hearing officers  as  shall  be  necessary  to  hear  and determine cases as provided by this article and  may promulgate such regulations as shall be necessary  or  desirable  to  effect  the purposes of this article. Such regulations may provide for a  schedule of monetary penalties to be used where an answer is made, other  than before a hearing officer, admitting a charge, provided that no such  penalty shall exceed the maximum fine established by law for the traffic  infraction involved."
VAT226,"Vehicle and Traffic       226.  Summons;  answer.  1.  Summons.  The  commissioner  shall  be  authorized to prescribe by regulation  the  form  for  the  summons  and  complaint to be used for all traffic violations specified in subdivision  one of section two hundred twenty-five of this chapter, and to establish  procedures  for  proper  administrative  controls  over  the disposition  thereof. Such summons may be the same as the  uniform  summons  provided  for  in  section  two hundred seven of this chapter. The chief executive  officer of each local police force which is required to use the  summons  and  complaint provided for herein shall prepare or cause to be prepared  such records and reports as may be prescribed by the commissioner.    2. Answer. (a) General. Any  person  who  receives  a  summons  for  a  violation   described   in   subdivision  one  of  section  two  hundred  twenty-five of this chapter shall  answer  such  summons  by  personally  appearing  on  the  return date at the time and place specified therein.  Provided, however, that an answer may be made as provided in  paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this subdivision and the regulations of the commissioner.    (b)  Answer  by  mail  -  admitting charge. If a person charged with a  violation admits to the violation as charged  in  the  summons,  he  may  complete  an appropriate form prescribed by the commissioner and forward  such form and  summons,  together  with  the  appropriate  part  of  his  license, if required by the commissioner's regulations, to the office of  the department specified on such summons. If a schedule of penalties for  violations has been established, and such schedule appears on the answer  form,  a  check  or  money  order  in  the amount of the penalty for the  violation charged if included in such schedule, must also  be  submitted  with   such   answer.   Unless  permitted  by  the  regulations  of  the  commissioner, such plea may not be made by  mail  for  any  offense  for  which suspension or revocation of a driver's license is required by law,  or  for  any  other  offense if the conviction thereof would result in a  hearing pursuant to a  highway  safety  program  established  under  the  provisions  of  subdivision  three  of  section five hundred ten of this  chapter.    (c) Answer by mail - denial of charges. If the person charged with the  violation denies part or all of the violation as charged in the summons,  he may complete an appropriate form prescribed by the  commissioner  for  that  purpose  and  forward  such  form and summons to the office of the  department specified on such summons. Upon receipt, such answer shall be  entered and a hearing date established by the department. The department  shall notify such person by return mail of the date of such hearing.    3. Failure to answer or appear; entry of order.   (a)  If  the  person  charged  with the violation shall fail to answer the summons as provided  herein, the commissioner may suspend such person's  license  or  driving  privilege  or,  if  the  charge  involves  a  violation of section three  hundred eighty-five, section four hundred one or  section  five  hundred  eleven-a of this chapter by a registrant who was not the operator of the  vehicle,  the registration of such vehicle or the privilege of operation  of any motor vehicle owned by such registrant may  be  suspended,  until  such person shall answer as provided in subdivision two of this section.  If a person shall fail to appear at a hearing, when such is provided for  pursuant  to  this  section,  such  person's license, or registration or  privilege of operating or of operation, as appropriate, may be suspended  pending appearance at a subsequent hearing, or the  disposition  of  the  charges  involved.  Any  suspension  permitted  by  this subdivision, if  already in effect, may be terminated or if not yet  in  effect,  may  be  withdrawn  or withheld, prior to the disposition of the charges involved  if such person shall appear and post security in  the  amount  of  forty  dollars  to guarantee his or her appearance at any required hearing. The  security posted pursuant to this  subdivision  shall  be  returned  upon  appearance  at  the  scheduled  hearing  or  an  adjourned hearing which  results in a final disposition of the charge,  and  otherwise  shall  be  forfeited. If a suspension has been imposed pursuant to this subdivision  and  the case is subsequently transferred pursuant to subdivision two of  section two hundred twenty-five of this article, such  suspension  shall  remain  in  effect  until the person answers the charges in the court to  which the case was transferred. Any suspension issued pursuant  to  this  paragraph  shall  be  subject  to  the  provisions of paragraph (j-1) of  subdivision two of section five hundred three of this chapter.    (b) Failure to answer or appear in accordance with the requirements of  this section and any regulations promulgated hereunder shall  be  deemed  an  admission  to the violation as charged, and an appropriate order may  be entered in the department's records, and a fine consistent  with  the  provisions  of  this  chapter and regulations of the commissioner may be  imposed by the commissioner or person designated  by  the  commissioner.  Prior  to  entry  of an order and imposition of a fine, the commissioner  shall notify such person by mail at the address of such person  on  file  with  the  department  or  at the current address provided by the United  States postal service in accordance with section two hundred fourteen of  this chapter: (i) of the violation charged; (ii) of the impending  entry  of such order and fine; (iii) that such order and fine may be filed as a  judgment  with  the  county clerk of the county in which the operator or  registrant is located; and (iv) that entry of such order and  imposition  of  such  fine may be avoided by entering a plea or making an appearance  within thirty days of the sending of such notice. In no case shall  such  an  order  and fine be entered and imposed more than two years after the  date of the alleged violation. Upon application in such manner and  form  as  the  commissioner shall prescribe an order and fine shall be vacated  upon the ground of excusable default."
VAT227,"Vehicle and Traffic      227. Hearings; determinations. 1. Every hearing for the adjudication  of  a  traffic  infraction,  as  provided by this article, shall be held  before a hearing officer appointed by the commissioner.  The  burden  of  proof  shall be upon the people, and no charge may be established except  by clear and convincing evidence. The  commissioner  may  prescribe,  by  rule or regulation, the procedures for the conduct of such hearings.    2. In any case wherein the people are not ready for the hearing on the  scheduled hearing date, the hearing officer may order a dismissal of the  charge  or  the  adjournment of the hearing to a subsequent time. In any  case wherein the people are not ready for  the  hearing  at  an  ordered  adjourned time and do not provide a minimum of seven days' notice to the  department  after  having been not ready for a hearing on the charge for  any reason previously, the charge shall be dismissed unless the  hearing  officer determines that a substantial traffic safety hazard would result  from  the  dismissal.  The  commissioner  shall  promulgate  regulations  concerning the adjournment of hearings which may permit the dismissal of  cases by a hearing officer for reasons not prescribed herein.    3. After due consideration of the evidence and arguments offered in  a  contested  case, the hearing officer shall determine whether the charges  have been established. Where the charges have not been  established,  an  order  dismissing the charges shall be entered. Where a determination is  made that a charge has been established, either in a contested  case  or  in  an  uncontested  case  where there is an appearance before a hearing  officer, or if  an  answer  admitting  the  charge  otherwise  has  been  received,  an  appropriate  order  shall  be entered in the department's  records.    4. a. An order entered upon the failure to answer or appear  or  after  the  receipt  of an answer admitting the charge or where a determination  is made that the charge has been established shall be civil  in  nature,  but  shall  be treated as a conviction for the purposes of this chapter.  The commissioner or his designee may include in such order an imposition  of any penalty authorized  by  any  provision  of  this  chapter  for  a  conviction  of  such  violation,  except that no penalty therefore shall  include imprisonment, nor, if monetary, exceed the amount  of  the  fine  which  could have been imposed had the charge been heard by a court. The  driver's license or privileges, or, if the charge involves  a  violation  of section three hundred eighty-five or section four hundred one of this  chapter  by  a  registrant  who was not the operator of the vehicle, the  registration of such vehicle or privilege  of  operation  of  any  motor  vehicle owned by such registrant may be suspended pending the payment of  any penalty so imposed. Any suspension issued pursuant to this paragraph  shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (j-1) of subdivision two  of section five hundred three of this chapter.    b. Unpaid fines may be recovered by the commissioner in a civil action  in  the name of the commissioner. In addition, as an alternative to such  civil action, and provided that no appeal is pending,  the  commissioner  may file with the county clerk of the county in which the person resides  a  final  order of the commissioner containing the amount of the fine or  fines. The filing of such final order shall  have  the  full  force  and  effect  of  a judgment duly docketed in the office of such clerk and may  be enforced in the same manner and with the same effect as that provided  by law in respect to execution issued against property upon judgments of  a court of record. No such civil action shall  be  commenced  nor  shall  such  final  order  be  filed  until  at  least  thirty  days  after the  department has posted by ordinary mail to the person at the  address  of  such  person  on  file  with  the  department  or at the current address  provided by the United States postal service notice  of  the  amount  of  such fine or fines and that such fine or fines are due and owing.    5.  All  penalties  and  forfeited  security collected pursuant to the  provisions of this article shall be paid to the department of audit  and  control  to the credit of the justice court fund and shall be subject to  the applicable provisions of section  eighteen  hundred  three  of  this  chapter.  After  such  audit  as  shall  reasonably  be  required by the  comptroller,  such  penalties  and  forfeited  security  shall  be  paid  quarterly  or,  in  the  discretion  of the comptroller, monthly, to the  appropriate jurisdiction in which the violation occurred  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of section ninety-nine-a of the state finance law,  except that the sum of four dollars for each violation occurring in such  jurisdiction  for  which  a  complaint   has   been   filed   with   the  administrative  tribunal  established  pursuant to this article shall be  retained by the state. The amount distributed  during  the  first  three  quarters to the cities of Rochester and Buffalo in any given fiscal year  shall  not  exceed seventy percent of the amount which will be otherwise  payable. Provided, however, that if the full costs of administering this  article shall exceed the amounts received and retained by the state  for  any  period  specified by the commissioner, then such additional sums as  shall be required to offset such costs shall be retained  by  the  state  out  of  the penalties and forfeited security collected pursuant to this  article.    6. Unless a hearing officer shall determine that a substantial traffic  safety  hazard  would  result  therefrom,  he  shall,  pursuant  to  the  regulations  of  the commissioner, delay for a period of thirty days the  effective date of any suspension or revocation of a drivers  license  or  vehicle  registration  imposed after a hearing pursuant to this article,  unless such suspension was imposed because  of  the  failure  to  pay  a  monetary  penalty. Provided, however, the commissioner's regulations may  provide for the immediate surrender of  any  item  to  be  suspended  or  revoked  and  the  issuance of appropriate temporary documentation to be  used during such thirty day period."

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, a transcript  of  the  hearing  resulting  in  the  determination  appealed  from  must be  submitted on any such appeal.    (c) If the only issue raised on appeal is the appropriateness  of  the  penalty  imposed,  the  appellant,  in  his  discretion, may submit such  appeal without a transcript of the hearing. In such event, the  decision  of  the  appeals  board may be based solely on the appeal papers and the  records of the department, and such decision shall  not  be  subject  to  judicial review.    (d)  Where  a  transcript  of  the hearing is submitted at the time an  appeal is filed, the determination of the appeals board will be  subject  to judicial review as prescribed in subdivision nine of this section.    3. Appeals boards. Each appeal filed pursuant to this section shall be  reviewed  by  an appeals board, which shall make a determination of such  appeal, and shall cause an  appropriate  order  to  be  entered  in  the  records of the department.    4.  Time  limitations. No appeal shall be reviewed if it is filed more  than thirty days after notice was given of  the  determination  appealed  from.    5.  Appeal  procedures.  Any person desiring to file an appeal from an  adverse determination pursuant to this section, shall do so  in  a  form  and  manner  provided by the commissioner. The transcript of any hearing  which formed the basis for such determination will be reviewed  only  if  it  is  submitted  by the appellant. An appeal shall not be deemed to be  finally submitted  until  the  appellant  has  submitted  all  forms  or  documents required to be submitted by the commissioner or this section.    6.  Transcript  of  hearings. Transcripts of the record of any hearing  may be obtained at the cost  to  the  department,  if  prepared  by  the  department,  or  at  the  rate  specified  in  the  contract between the  department and the contractor, if prepared by a private contractor.  The  amount paid at such cost or rate by a person convicted who submits, upon  an  appeal from the determination of guilt, or upon such appeal and upon  a review pursuant to the provisions  of  article  seventy-eight  of  the  civil  practice  law  and rules, a transcript of the hearing or hearings  which  resulted  in  such  determination,  shall  be  refunded  by   the  department  upon  a final determination by the appeals board, dismissing  the charges, or if the charges were sustained by the appeals board, upon  a final determination by the court, dismissing the charges.    7. Fees. The fee for filing an appeal shall be ten dollars. No  appeal  shall be accepted unless the required fee has been paid. Such fees shall  be  paid  by the appeals board to the department of audit and control to  the credit of the justice court fund.  After  such  audit  as  shall  be  required  by the comptroller, such fees shall be credited to the general  fund of the state.    8.  Stays  pending  appeal. Whenever a determination has not been made  within thirty days after an appeal has been finally submitted, a stay of  execution will be deemed granted by operation of law, and  the  license,  certificate, permit or privilege affected will be automatically restored  pending final determination.    9. Judicial review. (a) No determination of a hearing officer which is  appealable under the provisions of this section shall be reviewed in any  court  unless an appeal has been filed and determined in accordance with  this section.    (b) A  determination  of  the  appeals  board  in  any  case  where  a  transcript  of the hearing has been submitted shall be subject to review  pursuant to  the  provisions  of  article  seventy-eight  of  the  civil  practice  law  and  rules. Provided, however, a statement by the hearing  officer at the conclusion of the hearing  indicating  that  the  charges  have  been sustained and announcing the penalty imposed, together with a  summary of the reasons the appeal was denied by the appeals board, shall  constitute sufficient findings for the purpose of such review."
